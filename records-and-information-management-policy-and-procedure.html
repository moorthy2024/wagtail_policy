        <div class="content">
          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this policy and procedure is to provide direction to
            staff on the creation and management of information and records. It
            meets relevant legislation, regulations and Standards as set out in
            Schedule 1, Legislative References.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Information Management</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Management of each Participant’s
            information ensures that it is identifiable, accurately recorded,
            current and confidential. Each Participant’s information is easily
            accessible to the Participant and appropriately utilised by relevant
            workers.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              An information management system is maintained that is relevant
              and proportionate to the size and scale of the organisation and
              records each Participant’s information in an accurate and timely
              manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Documents are stored with appropriate use, access, transfer,
              storage, security, retrieval, retention, destruction and disposal
              processes relevant and proportionate to the scope and complexity
              of supports delivered.
            </li>
          </ul>

          </p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ information and records are a corporate asset,
            vital for supporting its ongoing operations and for providing
            evidence of business decisions, activities and transactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ information and records management practices meet
            its business needs, accountability requirements and stakeholder
            expectations. They also support all stages of the information
            lifecycle:
          </p>

          <p class="textCenter"><img src="images/records.jpg" alt="" /></p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>General</h3>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Services’ Human Resources Policy and Procedure, all
            staff must undergo initial training and orientation, which includes
            training in privacy, confidentiality and information management.
            Staff knowledge and application of confidentiality, privacy and
            information management processes is monitored on a day-to-day basis
            and through annual Performance Reviews. Additional formal and
            on-the-job training is provided to staff where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            All information, in paper copy, electronic or any other format,
            created by Wagtail Services staff in the course of their employment,
            or that is accessed by staff on Wagtail Services’ equipment, is the
            property of Wagtail Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Work-related information or storage devices (such as USB drives)
            must not be taken from Wagtail Services without permission from the
            Manager.
          </p>

          <h3>Creating Records</h3>

          <p>
            All Wagtail Services staff must create records of all business
            activities and decisions, including with respect to interacting with
            and supporting NDIS Participants. This includes file notes of verbal
            conversations related to Participant support or business activities,
            particularly where those conversations provide directions that need
            to be followed or queries that need to be followed up and answered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Information that should not be recorded includes information that is
            not related to Wagtail Services’ activities and decisions and
            duplicated information where an appropriate record has already been
            created.
          </p>

          <p>
            Records must be created in the most appropriate format for the
            information being recorded. For guidance on what format should be
            used to create a particular record, staff should consult the
            Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            Records created must contain all relevant detail and be accurate and
            objective. See the Participant Case Notes Policy and Procedure for
            guidance on recording support-related case notes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wherever possible, records should be created in digital format. Hard
            copy records should only be created when absolutely necessary (such
            as when they are required for legal purposes).
          </p>

          <h3>Storing Records</h3>

          <p>
            Records must be stored securely in the most appropriate system,
            whether it be physical (e.g. locked filing cabinets) or electronic.
            For guidance on what system should be used to store a particular
            record, staff should consult the Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            Records should be created and stored methodically and logically
            (e.g. in relevant categories, on relevant Participant or staff
            files, in chronological order, using naming conventions, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
            Where information is initially received in a digital format it
            should be retained in that format where possible (for instance, not
            printed and filed in hard copy). Digital records should only be
            converted to a different digital format if the content and quality
            of the record can be maintained.
          </p>

          <h3>Electronic Records</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ electronic records are stored securely in the
            following information management systems:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Zero for financial management;</li>
            <li>Visualcare for Participant record keeping</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff must use individual usernames and passwords to access these
            systems. The systems have back up and disaster management
            arrangements in place that are managed by the respective system
            suppliers.
          </p>

          <p>All Wagtail Services computers have password protection.</p>

          <p>
            Business records must not be stored in email folders, shared
            folders, personal drives or external storage devices such as USBs,
            as they are not secure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where an email is considered a Wagtail Services record, it must be
            captured in the relevant information management system as soon as
            possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Records created when using social media applications or mobile
            devices may also need to be captured in the relevant information
            management system.
          </p>

          <h3>Hard Copy Records</h3>

          <p>
            All hard copy records that contain private and confidential
            information about Participants, staff or Wagtail Services must be
            stored in a locked filing cabinet, in a lockable area, with access
            to authorised personnel only.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where it is necessary to remove private and confidential records
            from Wagtail Services’ premises, they must be stored securely in a
            non-transparent container (for example, a locked brief case).
          </p>

          <h3>Using Records</h3>

          <p>
            Access to Wagtail Services’ information management systems must be
            approved by the Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            Access to Wagtail Services’ information management systems will be
            reviewed regularly by the Manager and may be amended, suspended or
            terminated if a staff member’s employment situation changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must only access records that are necessary for them to fulfil
            their duties. More detail on access to and disclosure of records is
            provided in Wagtail Services’ Privacy and Confidentiality Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            To protect records when they are being used, staff must lock
            unattended computers and maintain a 'clean desk' policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Use of records by staff is monitored and file audits are undertaken
            to ensure files are complete, up-to-date, and procedures are being
            followed. The Manager also undertakes regular physical and digital
            access audits to ensure Wagtail Services continues to store records
            securely. See Schedule 2. Internal Review and External Audit
            Schedule for the regularity of these audits.
          </p>

          <h3>Retaining and Disposing of Records</h3>

          <p>
            Records that are not frequently used or that are not required for
            current business use (inactive records) may need to be:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              archived - if they need to be retained for a certain period; or
            </li>
            <li>
              disposed of - if they have already been kept for the required
              retention period.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Manager is responsible for identifying records that need to be
            retained or disposed as part of the file, physical and digital
            access audits detailed above.
          </p>

          <h3>Retention Periods</h3>

          <p>
            Records that are considered public must be retained for the periods
            set out in the New South Wales: relevant Functional Retention and
            Disposal Authority (NSW State Archives and Records)
            https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/recordkeeping/rules/retention-and-disposal-authorities/functional
          </p>

          <p>
            Queensland: relevant Retention and Disposal Schedule (Queensland
            State Archivist)
            https://www.forgov.qld.gov.au/search-retention-and-disposal-schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            In most cases Wagtail Services’ records are not public, but contain
            personal information, which is subject to QLD, NSW and Australian
            Privacy Law.
          </p>

          <p>
            All records relating to Wagtail Services’ NDIS operations and
            service delivery must be kept for a minimum of seven years from the
            date they were created.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) requires businesses to keep
            records for five years from the date they were created. For example,
            a document used in the 2016 financial year must be kept until the
            end of the 2021 financial year.
          </p>

          <h3>Archiving Hard Copy Records</h3>

          <p>
            Inactive hard copy records with less than 12 months of their
            retention period remaining should be kept in the same way and
            location as active records. Inactive records with 12 months or more
            of their retention period remaining should be archived.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inactive records that require archiving should be grouped with other
            similar records and placed in an archive box. All extraneous
            materials such as rubber bands, paperclips, bulldog clips, plastic
            sleeves and display folders should be removed. Staples do not need
            to be removed.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Contents List must be completed and attached to each archive box.
            Archive boxes must be numbered and stored in a secure location.
            Wagtail Services’ archived records are stored onsite in a locked
            room and protected from pests, water, damp and fire.

          <h3>Archiving Electronic Records</h3>

          <p>
            Where electronic records are not held in an information management
            system, they must be stored on a secure internal or external storage
            device. The file formats and the devices records are kept on must be
            able to be read for as long as the record is required to be
            retained.
          </p>

          <h3>Disposing of Records</h3>

          <p>

            required retention period. Where a New South Wales: relevant

          <h3>Disposing of Electronic Records</h3>

          <p>
            The “delete” function is not sufficient to destroy electronic
            records as the information may still be recoverable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Electronic records must be destroyed either by physical destruction
            of the storage device they are held on, or by clearing or purging
            the records held on the device.
