          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this policy and procedure is to ensure the safety of
            staff, Participants and others during emergencies and other service
            interruptions.
          </p>

            It applies to all staff and meets relevant legislation, regulations
            and Standards as set out in Schedule 1, Legislative References. It
            should be read in conjunction with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Work Health and
            Safety Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Risk Management</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Risks to Participants, workers and the
            provider are identified and managed.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Risks to the organisation, including risks to
              <strong>Participants</strong>, financial and
              <strong>work health and safety</strong> risks, and risks
              associated with provision of supports are identified, analysed,
              prioritised and treated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support delivery is linked to a risk management system which
              includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Incident Management;</li>
                <li>Complaints Management;</li>
                <li>Work Health and Safety;</li>
                <li>Human Resource Management;</li>
                <li>Financial Management;</li>
                <li>Information Management; and</li>
                <li>Governance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Safe Environment</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Each Participant accesses supports in a
            safe environment that is appropriate to their needs.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Where supports are provided in the Participantâ€™s home, work is
              undertaken with the Participant to ensure a safe support delivery
              environment.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Continuity of Supports</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Each Participant has access to timely and
            appropriate support without interruption.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Day-to-day operations are managed in an efficient and effective
              way to avoid disruption and ensure continuity of supports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where changes or interruptions are unavoidable, alternative
              arrangements are explained and agreed with the Participant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where applicable, disaster preparedness and planning measures are
              in place to enable continuation of critical supports before,
              during and after a disaster.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Definitions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Altering or ceasing services:</strong> Services may at
              times need to be altered or ceased due to emergencies. This may be
              due to direct risk or impact on the location itself or because
              travel in the area is considered too unsafe.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Leaving early:</strong> the practice of relocating well in
              advance of an emergency. This activity is undertaken by households
              in response to a range of triggers such as a weather forecast or
              flood warning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emergency planning:</strong> identification of potential
              events that could have a negative effect on an organisation and/or
              its services, and the actions that can be taken to minimise the
              impact or extent of damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Evacuation:</strong> â€“ the urgent movement of Participants
              to a safer location in response to an imminent threat or impact of
              an emergency. An evacuation without any prior warning is resource
              intensive and potentially detrimental to the health of
              Participants, staff and emergency services personnel. The main
              priority when deciding to evacuate is the protection of life. An
              evacuation must be effectively planned and executed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extreme heat or heatwave:</strong> a period of unusual and
              uncomfortable hot weather that could negatively affect human
              health. Extreme heat can also affect community infrastructure
              (such as power supply and public transport) and other services.
              Extreme heat can affect everyone, however some people, including
              people with a disability, are more vulnerable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Organisational Resilience:</strong> the ability of a
              business to rapidly respond to and recover from emergencies,
              critical disruptions or threats, and continue operating with
              limited impact on service delivery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Relocation:</strong> the planned movement of Participants
              and an appropriate number of staff from a facility or home to
              alternative accommodation with a similar type of care available,
              in response to a forecast or warning of potential or actual
              emergency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shelter in place:</strong> to remain on site within an
              existing facility or home during an emergency. The decision to
              shelter in place is based on information from a variety of sources
              that confirms this option is safer or more appropriate than
              relocation or evacuation. The movement of Participants from one
              facility or home to another safer building within the same
              location is also considered shelter in place.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shelter indoors:</strong> to remain inside a building and
              limit the exposure to unhealthy conditions in the air outside such
              as gas leaks, smoke and other air contaminants. On receiving
              advice to shelter indoors, people must go indoors immediately,
              close all doors and windows, turn off heaters, air conditioners
              and exhaust fans, and listen to radio or television or monitor
              emergency services websites for the all clear message.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vulnerable person:</strong> someone living in the
              community who is:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  older, frail, and/or physically, intellectually or cognitively
                  impaired; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  unable to comprehend warnings and directions and/or respond in
                  an emergency situation

          <h2>Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services plans for emergencies in order to protect the
            safety and wellbeing of Participants and staff and to ensure
            Participants have access to supports without interruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services will ensure essential services are maintained as
            far as is practicable and that full service delivery is recommenced
            as soon as possible after an emergency.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>Emergency Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services must take an â€˜all hazardsâ€™ approach when preparing
            for, responding to and recovering from emergencies. This includes
            planning for a range of possible emergencies such as fire, bushfire,
            flood, relocation, evacuation and prolonged service interruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Directors will prepare, test and annually review an Emergency
            Plan for Wagtail Services, in consultation with all relevant staff
            and Participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emergency Plan, or a summary of key elements of the plan, must
            be readily accessible by staff and on display in Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            premises.
          </p>
          <p>The Emergency Plan must include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              how serious accidents, fire, flood, other natural disasters will
              be responded to;
            </li>
            <li>
              contact details for key staff who have specific roles or
              responsibilities under the plan, for example, fire wardens and
              first aid officers;
            </li>
            <li>
              contact details for local emergency services (e.g. police, fire
              brigade and poison information centre) and medical assistance;
            </li>
            <li>
              a description of how people will be alerted to an emergency or
              possible emergency, for example, sirens or alarms (at Wagtail
              Servicesâ€™ office) and by phoning affected Participants or their
              supporters
            </li>
            <li>
              a map of Wagtail Servicesâ€™ workplace, illustrating the location of
              fire protection equipment, emergency exits and assembly points;
            </li>
            <li>
              evacuation procedures, including arrangements for assisting any
              people with hearing, vision or mobility impairment;
            </li>
            <li>
              testing of emergency procedures, including the frequency of
              testing; and
            </li>
            <li>
              information, training and instruction to relevant staff on
              implementing the emergency procedures.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Emergency Plan must be tailored to the businessâ€™ location and
            circumstances and be based on consultation with local health and
            emergency services.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event of an emergency, Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Emergency Plan must
            be implemented. Directions from emergency services workers must also
            be complied with.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Leadership Team will review Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Emergency Plan at
            least annually and:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              when there are changes to the workplace such as re-location or
              refurbishments;
            </li>
            <li>
              when there are changes in the number or composition of staff
              including an increase in the use of temporary contractors;
            </li>
            <li>when new activities have been introduced; and</li>
            <li>after the plan has been tested.</li>
            <li>
              Wagtail Services will communicate any changes to the plan as a
              result of reviews as soon as practicable to all affected staff and
              stakeholders.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Operational Readiness</h3>
          <p>
            The Directors must ensure Wagtail Services is prepared to rapidly
            respond in an emergency. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>having an Emergency Plan in place;</li>
            <li>
              ensuring the Emergency Plan is tested and linked to broader
              community emergency frameworks;
            </li>
            <li>
              actively engaging with local emergency service agencies and local
              government about how to respond in different emergencies;
            </li>
            <li>
              regularly testing emergency management and evacuation procedures;
            </li>
            <li>
              being prepared to make informed decisions about staff and
              Participant safety and whether to cease services, relocate staff
              or Participants, or direct staff and Participants to shelter
              indoors;
            </li>
            <li>
              considering how support for Participants can be continued if
              services need to be altered or ceased in an emergency;
            </li>
            <li>
              planning how to respond if critical infrastructure (e.g. Client
              Management System) fails during an emergency, such as power
              failures;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring staff are aware of their roles and responsibilities in
              the event of an emergency;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring all relevant contact details (such as staff,
              Participants, next of kin, emergency services, and relevant
              government agencies) are up to date and available; and
            </li>
            <li>
              training staff to implement emergency procedures, ensuring they
              are equipped to address individual Participant needs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Staff must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ensure all Participant information, including contact details for
              the Participant and next of kin, are up to date and easily
              accessible;
            </li>
            <li>
              consider Participantsâ€™ needs in a range of possible emergency
              events;
            </li>
            <li>
              communicate the Emergency Plan to relevant stakeholders, for
              example, Participants, family members and related service
              providers;
            </li>
            <li>
              as part of support planning, ensure alternative plans for
              Participants exist if service delivery is interrupted;
            </li>
            <li>
              support Participants living independently to develop their own
              personal emergency plan; and
            </li>
            <li>
              notify Participants and their next of kin where relevant, of all
              relocations and service cessations related to emergencies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Obtaining Emergency Information</h3>
          <p>
            In the event of an emergency situation, the Manager will obtain
            information about current and forecast conditions from radio,
            television the internet and its local networks.
          </p>

          <p>
            For any high risk or high needs clients, the Manager will also make
            contact with local emergency services to advise of the situation and
            potential support that may be needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Fire Safety</h3>
          <p>
            The Manager must ensure that fire equipment is installed, suitable
            for risks specific to Wagtail Servicesâ€™ workplace and be readily
            accessible in accordance with the relevant Australian Standards.
            Fire extinguishers must be placed away from heat sources and
            regularly maintained, with at least 1 metre of clearance to access
            the extinguisher.
          </p>

          <p>
            Signage within Wagtail Servicesâ€™ premises must assist people to find
            fire equipment quickly and identify what type of fire it can be used
            on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will determine which staff require training in the
            use of first response procedures and fire equipment, based on the
            nature of their position and on risk assessment. Refresher training
            will be provided annually.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager must ensure fire equipment is regularly tested by
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ local fire authority or fire equipment supplier in
            accordance with Schedule 2 Internal Review and External Audit
            Schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emergency exits must be kept clear at all times. Emergency exits
            must be kept unlocked and unblocked and all exit signs must be
            maintained and kept illuminated.
          </p>

          <h3>Power Failure</h3>
          <p>
            Power failures can be common and unexpected so the Emergency Plan
            should include a plan to ensure supports can continue to be provided
            during them. Strategies include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              having access to a phone, such as a charged mobile phone or land
              line that doesn't rely on electricity to operate;
            </li>
            <li>
              having access to alternate lighting, such as a torch or a
              battery-operated light;
            </li>
            <li>having access to a battery-powered radio;</li>
            <li>having access to fresh water;</li>
            <li>
              considering the safety of food supplies and alternative cooking
              arrangements if the electricity in a Participantâ€™s residence has
              an outage;
            </li>
            <li>
              where Participants require an uninterrupted power supply (for
              instance, for life support equipment) considering how they can be
              supported (such as contacting their electricity retailer and
              ensuring the retailer has the Participantâ€™s up-to-date contact
              details), or letting the Participantâ€™s supporter know to do the
              same;
            </li>
            <li>
              if a Participantâ€™s medication may have been compromised, contact
              the Directors to organise new medication to be dispensed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Extreme Weather</h3>
          <p>
            The Emergency Plan should also plan for extreme weather (such as
            extreme heat or cold) that is likely to occur where Wagtail Services
            supports are delivered. The plan should help staff identify which
            Participants are most at risk and the support they may require.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support Participants on extreme heat days or during heatwaves,
            staff must be aware of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>which Participants are most at risk;</li>
            <li>
              how to assist Participants to reduce the risk of heat related
              illnesses;
            </li>
            <li>how to recognise heat related symptoms; and</li>
            <li>what to do if a Participant is heat affected.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On days above 30 degrees Celsius, staff should encourage
            Participants to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>drink plenty of water, even if they donâ€™t feel thirsty;</li>
            <li>
              spend as much time as possible in cool or air conditioned
              buildings (shopping centres, libraries or community centres);
            </li>
            <li>wear light coloured, loose fitting clothing;</li>
            <li>stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day;</li>
            <li>wear a hat and apply sunscreen;</li>
            <li>avoid strenuous activity, cancel or postpone outings;</li>
            <li>avoid alcohol and caffeine;</li>
            <li>close curtains or blinds to block out the sun; and</li>
            <li>use wet towels and cold foot baths to cool themselves down.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services also requires all staff to follow the same
            precautions when working on hot days to ensure their health and
            wellbeing is maintained.
          </p>

          <h3>Organisational Resilience</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to planning for the safety and wellbeing of staff and
            Participants in an emergency, Wagtail Servicesâ€™ emergency planning
            is also based on strengthening its organisational resilience â€“ or
            building the businessâ€™ capacity to continue providing necessary
            services during emergencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support this, Wagtail Services undertakes organisational risk
            assessments related to business continuity and disaster management
            and recovery. It also develops specific Business Continuity Plans to
            complement its emergency planning activities. See the Risk
            Management Policy and Procedure for more detail.
          </p>

          <h3>Participant Readiness</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ services may need to be changed, ceased or
            relocated in the event of an emergency or other service
            interruption. Support planning for all Participants must consider
            how services can continue to be provided in these situations. This
            includes, for instance, considering how changes to services will be
            communicated to Participants and alternative supports that could be
            provided should Wagtail Services be unable to deliver normal
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            For services provided to a Participant in their own home (whether
            rented or owned by the Participant), Wagtail Services expects that
            they (and where appropriate, the owner of the home) will be
            responsible for their own fire safety and ensure the home meets all
            relevant building laws, regulations and legislation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants receiving services in their home should be encouraged
            and supported to develop personal emergency plans that cater for all
            types of emergencies and address their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services staff will support Participants with personal
            emergency planning in the following situations:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              where Wagtail Services provides the majority of supports required
              by a Participant, and these supports are provided in the
              Participantâ€™s home;
            </li>
            <li>
              where multiple providers support the Participant and it is agreed
              by all providers and the Participant that Wagtail Services will
              support the Participant with personal emergency planning; and/or
            </li>
            <li>
              where assessment and planning activities identify that the
              Participant requires support with personal emergency planning.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Staff will support Participants to exercise choice and control in
            emergency planning by listening to their needs and preferences and
            involving them and their families and carers in the planning
            process.
          </p>
          <p>Key considerations include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>health needs;</li>
            <li>transportation;</li>
            <li>
              location of the Participantâ€™s home in regard to fire or flood
              risks; and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring emergency information is available and relevant for the
              Participant.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Personal emergency management plans should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              be appropriate to the location, physical environment and
              Participant and staff profile;
            </li>
            <li>
              include planned emergency responses for different emergency
              situations, such as options for altering or ceasing services,
              relocation, sheltering and evacuation;
            </li>
            <li>
              include clear triggers for when the plan is activated, including
              processes for maintaining situational awareness and sourcing
              accurate and up-to-date information;
            </li>
            <li>
              be tailored to meet the particular CALD needs of Participants,
              such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and
              communities, to ensure a culturally responsive approach;
            </li>
            <li>
              outline clear authority for decision making and communication
              arrangements; and
            </li>
            <li>
              include business continuity arrangements and options should
              emergency services be unable to respond immediately.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Personal emergency plans should be reviewed and updated regularly as
            part of the Participantâ€™s Support Plan reviews.
          </p>
          <h3>Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            Incidents relating to emergencies and service interruptions should
            be reported in accordance with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Incident Management
            policies and procedures.
