          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

          <p>
            This policy and procedure sets out the approach Wagtail Services
            takes to assessment, planning and review with respect to Participant
            Support Plans, once a person has been offered and accepted Wagtail
            Services’ services.
          </p>

          <p>
            This Policy and Procedure applies to all Participants of Wagtail
            Services’ services, their family members, carers and other
            supporters, and meets relevant legislation, regulations and
            Standards as set out in Schedule 1, Legislative References.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Support Planning</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant is actively involved in the development of their
            support plans. Support plans reflect Participant needs,
            requirements, preferences, strengths and goals, and are regularly
            reviewed.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              With each Participant’s consent, work is undertaken with the
              Participant and their support network to enable effective
              assessment and to develop a support plan. Appropriate information
              and access is sought from a range of resources to ensure the
              Participant’s needs, support requirements, preferences, strengths
              and goals are included in the assessment and the support plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              In collaboration with each Participant, a risk assessment is
              completed and documented for each Participant’s support plan, then
              appropriate strategies to treat known risks are planned and
              implemented.
            </li>
            <li>
              Periodic reviews of the effectiveness of risk management
              strategies are undertaken with each Participant to ensure risks
              are being adequately addressed, and changes are made when
              required.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each support plan is reviewed annually or earlier in collaboration
              with each Participant, according to their changing needs or
              circumstances. Progress in meeting desired outcomes and goals is
              assessed, at a frequency relevant and proportionate to risks, the
              Participant’s functionality and the Participant’s wishes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where progress is different from expected outcomes and goals, work
              is done with the Participant to change and update the support
              plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where appropriate, and with the consent of the Participant,
              information on the support plan is communicated to family members,
              carers, other providers and relevant government agencies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Service Agreements with Participants</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant has a clear understanding of the supports they have
            chosen and how they will be provided.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Collaboration occurs with each Participant to develop a Service
              Agreement which establishes expectations, explains the supports to
              be delivered, and specifies any conditions attached to the
              delivery of supports, including why these conditions are attached.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Participant is supported to understand their Service
              Agreement and conditions using the language, mode of communication
              and terms that the Participant is most likely to understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where the Service Agreement is created in writing, each
              Participant receives a copy of their agreement signed by the
              Participant and the provider. Where this is not practicable, or
              the Participant chooses not to have an agreement, a record is made
              of the circumstances under which the Participant did not receive a
              copy of their agreement.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Responsive Support Provision</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant accesses responsive, timely, competent and
            appropriate supports to meet their needs, desired outcomes and
            goals.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Supports are provided based on the least intrusive options, in
              accordance with contemporary evidence-informed practices that meet
              Participant needs and help achieve desired outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where agreed in the Service Agreement, and with the Participant’s
              consent or direction, links are developed and maintained through
              collaboration with other providers to share information and meet
              Participant needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reasonable efforts are made to involve the Participant in
              selecting their workers, including the preferred gender of workers
              providing personal care supports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a Participant has specific needs which require monitoring
              and/or daily support, workers are appropriately trained and
              understand the Participant’s needs and preferences.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Transitions to or from the Provider</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant experiences a planned and coordinated transition to
            or from the provider.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A planned transition to or from the provider is facilitated in
              collaboration with each Participant when possible, and this is
              documented, communicated and effectively managed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Risks associated with each transition to or from the provider are
              identified, documented and responded to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Processes for transitioning to or from the provider are developed,
              applied, reviewed and communicated.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services ensures Participants access supports that promote,
            uphold and respect their legal and human rights and are enabled to
            exercise informed choice and control. The provision of supports
            promotes, upholds and respects individual rights to freedom of
            expression, self- determination and decision-making.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where Participants are transferring from other services, the
            transition is collaboratively planned, and the process is
            documented, communicated and effectively managed.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>General</h3>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Services’ Human Resources Policy and Procedure, all
            staff must undergo initial training and orientation, which includes
            training in assessment, planning and review processes. Staff
            knowledge and application of this policy and procedure is monitored
            on a day-to-day basis and through annual Performance Reviews.
            Additional formal and on-the-job training is provided to staff where
            required.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services uses its Participant Charter, Participant Handbook
            to provide Participants, families, carers and all other stakeholders
            with information about this policy and procedure, in an easy to
            understand format.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants understand this information, staff must
            provide information to them and their supporters in ways that suit
            their individual communication needs. Written information can be
            provided in Easy English or explained verbally by staff. Staff can
            also help Participants access interpreters or advocates where
            required.
          </p>

          <p>
            All documentation relating to assessment, planning and review must
            be maintained on Participant files and tracked in Nightingale.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of all assessment, planning and review activities, staff
            must discuss Participants’ legal and human rights, as well as their
            responsibilities, with them. They must confirm Participants’
            understanding verbally, using an interpreter or advocate where
            required.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of all assessment, planning and review activities, the
            Participants’ engagement with their family, friends and community
            must be a key focus, ensuring that the engagement is directed by the
            Participant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must also advise the person of their right to involve a
            support person in their dealings with Wagtail Services. Where
            required, Participants must be provided with information and support
            to access a person of their choice, such as an advocate, to assist
            them to access the service. For more information see Wagtail
            Services’ Decision Making and Choice Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            In accordance with Wagtail Services’ Privacy and Confidentiality
            Policy and Procedure, respect for and protection of Participants’
            privacy and confidentiality must be reinforced on an ongoing basis,
            verbally and in literature provided by staff.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where a language or cultural barrier is identified, staff must
            engage an interpreter or an appropriate external agency to support
            the person.
          </p>

          <p>
            If necessary and with the Participant’s consent, other parties such
            as service providers who deliver existing or complementary services
            will be included in assessment, planning and review activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must accept the Participant’s wishes with respect to accepting
            or rejecting particular support options.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should a person request assistance with Support Planning that is
            beyond the scope of this policy and procedure, the person should be
            directed to the NDIA to discuss Support Coordination. Referral and
            support to connect the person to Agency should be provided within 5
            working days and in accordance with Wagtail Services’ Providing
            Information, Advice and Referral Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will ensure Wagtail Services remains up to date with all
            contemporary evidence-informed assessment, planning and review
            practices as part of their continuous improvement responsibilities
            and improving Participant outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will participate in industry forums and keep abreast of
            industry research and articles to determine if and how any changes
            to practices can be implemented into Wagtail Services’ service
            delivery.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will ensure all staff are advised of any updates in
            Wagtail Services’ processes as a result of the changes, to ensure
            consistency throughout service delivery.
          </p>

            Following their Intake Interview, where a Participant is offered
            services and accepts, staff will work with them and their
            supporter/s to assess their needs and develop and agree upon a
            Service Agreement. Staff will meet with the Participant and their
            supporter/s within 5 working days of their acceptance, or sooner if
            able, for an Assessment and Planning Interview.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will conduct all Assessment and Planning Interviews. The
            assessment will take into account:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the Participant’s needs (including health, wellbeing and safety
              needs), goals and longer-term aspirations;
            </li>
            <li>
              the supports that can be provided by Wagtail Services to meet
              those, based on the least intrusive approach and in accordance
              with contemporary, evidence-informed practices;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant’s support network, and how they can be supported
              to engage with this;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant’s age, ability, gender, sexual identity, culture,
              diversity, values, beliefs religion or spirituality;
            </li>
            <li>
              any barriers to community participation and strategies that could
              be put in place to help the Participant overcome them;
            </li>
            <li>
              identification of alternative service delivery plans in instances
              where service delivery may be interrupted; and
            </li>
            <li>
              how, when, and where the Participant requires supports to be
              delivered.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where possible, support provided to Participants by Wagtail Services
            should:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              support them to develop, maintain and strengthen independence,
              problem solving, social and self-care skills appropriate to their
              age, developmental stage and cultural circumstances;
            </li>
            <li>
              respect their right to practice their culture, values and beliefs;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              help them take control of and responsibility for their choices and
              enhance their autonomy, independence and community participation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Services’ Risk Management Policy and Procedure, a
            risk assessment for each Participants’ Support Plan must be
            completed and documented using a Participant Risk Assessment. This
            must also include appropriate strategies to treat risks, and how
            these will be planned and implemented.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where relevant, the interview must take into account information
            already provided about the person in their NDIS Plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outcomes of the assessment will be recorded using Wagtail Services’
            Initial Support Assessment Form. A copy of the assessment must be
            provided to the Participant. A copy will also be kept on the
            Participant’s file and key elements captured in Nightingale. Where
            the Participant chooses not to take a copy, staff must include a
            case note on the Participant’s file explaining the reasons why the
            Participant did not receive a copy of their assessment.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Participants Transitioning to Wagtail Services from Other Services
          </h3>

          <p>
            Where a Participant is transferring from another service provider,
            Wagtail Services must seek consent from the Participant and/or their
            supporters to contact other providers, (for example, government
            departments, the NDIA or other service providers) to discuss or
            obtain the person’s support requirements, Support Plan and
            information about their needs and goals, in order to assist their
            transition.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will meet with the Participant, their supporters and
            representatives from other relevant services (with the Participant’s
            consent) to develop a Transition Plan for the Participant.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Plan must clearly identify the timeframe for the transition and
            who is responsible for managing the steps involved in the
            transition, with the aim of minimising the impact of change on the
            Participant. In addition, risks associated with the transition must
            be identified, documented and responded to.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Transition Planning process should also incorporate the Support
            Planning processes outlined below. A copy of the Transition Plan
            must be provided to the Participant. A copy must also be kept on the
            Participant’s file and key elements captured in Nightingale. Where
            this is not practicable, or the Participant chooses not to have a
            Transition Plan, staff must include a case note on the Participant’s
            file explaining the reasons why the Participant did not receive a
            copy of their plan.
          </p>

          <h3>Planning</h3>

          <p>
            Staff must work with Participants and their supporters to formalise
            the supports to be provided by Wagtail Services in a Service
            Agreement. The Service Agreement can be tailored to the individual
            needs of each Participant.
          </p>

          <p>The Service Agreement must include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a Support Plan setting out:
              <ul>
                <li>the supports that will be provided;</li>
                <li>the support staff who will provide the supports; and</li>
                <li>
                  how, when, and where the Participant requires the supports to
                  be delivered;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              the period for when the Participant requires the supports to be
              provided;
            </li>
            <li>fees associated with the supports to be provided;</li>
            <li>
              any conditions attached to the delivery of supports, including why
              these conditions are attached;
            </li>
            <li>when and how the Service Agreement will be reviewed;</li>
            <li>
              how the Participant and Wagtail Services will deal with any
              problems or questions that arise, including complaint handling and
              dispute resolution;
            </li>
            <li>
              what the Participant’s and their supporter’s responsibilities are
              under the Service Agreement;
            </li>
            <li>
              what Wagtail Services responsibilities are under the Service
              Agreement; and
            </li>
            <li>
              what notice is needed for the Participant or Wagtail Services to
              change or end the Service Agreement and how this is done.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Service Agreements must be prepared within a timely manner following
            initial assessments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must ensure the Participant (and their supporter/s)
            understands their plan or are supported to understand it. Staff must
            provide information to them and their supporters in ways that suit
            their individual communication needs. Written information can be
            provided in Easy English or explained verbally by staff. Staff can
            also help Participants access interpreters or advocates where
            required.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the Participant (and their supporter/s) agree, service delivery
            may commence prior to the signing of the Service Agreement. A copy
            of the Service Agreement must be provided to the Participant. A copy
            must also be kept on the Participant’s file and key elements
            captured in Nightingale. Where this is not practicable, or the
            Participant chooses not to have an agreement, staff must include a
            case note on the Participant’s file explaining the reasons why the
            Participant did not receive a copy of their agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants’ relevant assessment documentation must be provided to
            the support staff who will work with them, prior to those staff
            commencing work with them, to ensure the Participant’s service
            delivery is consistent with their expressed preferences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where possible, staff must involve the Participant in selecting
            their support staff, including the preferred gender and cultural
            background of staff providing personal care supports. Selection of
            support staff must also be based on the staff member’s ability to
            meet the Participant’s specific needs. Where these needs require
            monitoring and/or daily support, support staff will be provided with
            any additional training required to understand the Participant’s
            needs and preferences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where agreed in the Service Agreement, and with the Participant’s
            consent or direction, staff must also develop and maintain
            collaborative links with other providers in order to share
            information and meet the Participant’s needs. Links and referrals to
            other services must be provided in accordance with Wagtail Services’
            Providing Information, Advice and Referrals Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where appropriate, and with the consent of the Participant,
            information about the Participant’s Support Plan may be communicated
            to family members, carers, other providers and relevant government
            agencies to ensure holistic support is provided.
          </p>

          <h3>Reviews</h3>

          <p>
            Staff, with the relevant stakeholders, must review the provision of
            supports for each Participant at least annually with the Participant
            and their supporter/s. Flexibility will be provided regarding the
            timing of review assessments, based on Participants’ needs and
            wishes, risks and functioning.
          </p>

          <p>Reviews must include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the Participant’s needs (including health, wellbeing and safety
              needs), goals and longer-term aspirations;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant’s progress towards addressing their needs and
              achieving their goals;
            </li>
            <li>recognition and celebration of the Participant’s progress;</li>
            <li>
              the Participant’s and their supporters’ age, ability, gender,
              sexual identity, culture, diversity, values, beliefs, religion or
              spirituality;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant’s support network and how they can be supported to
              engage with this;
            </li>
            <li>
              any barriers to community participation and strategies that could
              be put in place to help Participants overcome them; and
            </li>
            <li>
              whether there needs to be a change to the supports provided,
              ensuring new supports are based on the least intrusive approach
              and provided in accordance with contemporary, evidence-informed
              practices.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Participant Risk Assessments and the effectiveness of risk
            management strategies must also be reviewed with each Participant to
            ensure risks are being adequately addressed and that changes are
            being made when required.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where a Participant’s progress is different from expected outcomes
            and goals, the Support Plan must be updated and attached to the
            Participant’s Service Agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the Participant wishes to change their service delivery outside
            of the review cycle, they can request a review with the Manager at
            any time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outcomes of reviews must be recorded using Wagtail Services’
            Participant Support Review Form. Copies (and, if applicable, updated
            Support Plans) must be provided to Participants. Copies must also be
            kept on Participant files and key elements captured in Nightingale.
            Where a Participant chooses not to take a copy, staff must include a
            case note on their file explaining the reasons why they did not
            receive a copy of their review.
          </p>

            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Continuous Improvement Register will be used to
            record improvements identified and monitor the progress of their
