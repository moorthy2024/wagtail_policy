          <h3>Assets</h3>
          <p>
            Details of all assets owned by Wagtail Services are recorded in an
            Asset Register. When an asset is sold or otherwise disposed of, the
            details of the disposal (such as sale proceeds) are recorded in the
            Asset Register.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where an asset is lost, damaged, or destroyed, Wagtail Services will

            depreciation will be recorded in accordance with the Australian
            Accounting Standards.
          </p>

          <h3>Insurance</h3>
          <p>
            The Directors are responsible for ensuring all people and equipment
            associated with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ operations are covered by all
            necessary insurances. Insurances are recorded in an Insurances
            Register, which includes the type of insurance, policy name and
            number, annual premium and expiry date of each policy.

            expiry and reflect the businessâ€™ requirements as well as market
            conditions.
          </p>

          <h3>Budget Processes and Financial Planning</h3>
          <p>
            The External Accountant prepares annual itemised budgets for Wagtail
            Services for each financial year in consultation with Wagtail
            Servicesâ€™ independent accountant. Budget development takes into
            account the current and previous year's income and expenditure, any
            known changes to funding arrangements and expected cost changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of financial planning and preparing the budget, the External
            Accountant will record all important assumptions, develop a
            break-even analysis and prepare a projected profit and loss report.
          </p>

          <p>
            Annual budgets for each financial year must be endorsed by the
            Leadership Team by no later than the July of that financial year.
          </p>

          <h3>Payroll</h3>
          <p>Payroll is processed fortnightly by the External Accountant.</p>

          <p>
            The External Accountant prepares quarterly financial reports for
            review by the Leadership Team.
          </p>

          <p>
            In each new financial year, the External Accountant will ensure that
            the previous year's financials are documented and archived.
          </p>

          <h3>Quarterly Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            Financial reporting will also include reviewing performance against
            set KPIs, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the number of new clients vs target;</li>
            <li>operating costs vs budget;</li>
            <li>supplier costs vs budget; and</li>
            <li>payroll costs vs budget.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Financial reports will be prepared and overseen by the External
            Accountant.
          </p>

          <h3>External Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            The External Accountant is responsible for reconciling Wagtail
            Servicesâ€™ accounts at the end of each financial quarter and
            submitting Business Activity Statements to the Australian Tax Office
            (ATO) within the required timeframe.
          </p>

          <p>
            The External Accountant is also responsible for reporting
            Superannuation and Pay As You Go (PAYG) tax withholding amounts to
            the ATO. Visualcare has Single Touch Payroll (STP) functionality
            that allows Wagtail Services to report tax and super information for
            all staff to the ATO as payroll is processed.
          </p>

          <p>
            All Superannuation must be paid to the correct super funds within
            the timeframe required. BAS and PAYG amounts must be paid to the ATO
            by their due date. The External Accountant must contact the ATO
            should Wagtail Services be unable to make any of these payments on
            time.
          </p>

          <h3>Fraud and Corruption</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Directors and Manager are responsible for ensuring
            staff are trained in and understand what fraudulent practices are,
            how to identify potential fraud and how to report fraud.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where a staff member, Participant or other stakeholder identifies
            suspected fraud or corruption, they must make an initial report to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the Directors (unless that person may be implicated); or</li>
            <li>the Police.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All reports of fraud or corruption must be treated confidentially
            and referred to the Leadership Team. The Directors will record all
            reports of actual and suspected fraud or corruption, noting the
            nature of the report, the time received, and remedial actions
            planned and taken. A copy of these records must be made available to
            relevant authorities upon request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any internal discipline or misconduct investigations relating to
            staff as a result of a fraud or corruption allegation must be
            conducted in accordance with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Human Resources
            Policy and Procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, during the course of a disciplinary investigation, it is
            determined that a criminal offence such as fraud or corruption may
            have been committed, a report must be made to the police. To ensure
            that a criminal investigation is not compromised, clearance may need
            to be sought from the police for Wagtail Services to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>continue the disciplinary investigation;</li>
            <li>notify the staff member of misconduct allegations;</li>
            <li>
              interview witnesses to inform a disciplinary investigation; and
            </li>
            <li>
              release information to the staff member or their representative.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>NDIS Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ financial arrangements regarding NDIS service
            delivery must comply with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the NDIS Act 2013 (Cth), the NDIS Rules, all relevant NDIS
              guidelines, and all policies issued by the NDIA, including the
              NDIS Terms of Business for Registered Providers; and
            </li>
            <li>
              all other relevant Commonwealth or state law and other
              requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Pricing for supports must be endorsed by the Leadership Team and be
            based on the price controls and quoting requirements set out in the
            NDIS Price Guide, as well as the NDIS Provider SIL Pack Training
            Guide and FAQs and related templates.
          </p>

          <p>Wagtail Services must not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              add charges to the cost of supports, such as credit card
              surcharges or any additional fees;
            </li>
            <li>request payment before the support has been delivered; or</li>
            <li>
              charge cancellation fees, except in circumstances identified in
              the NDIS Price Guide.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Pricing for supports provided to Participants who self-manage their
            NDIS funding may be negotiated with the Participant or their
            representative independently to the NDIS Price Guide.
          </p>

          <p>
            GST will not be charged on supports that are considered GST-free
            under the GST-free Supply (National Disability Insurance Scheme
            Supports) Determination 2017.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Directors must maintain full and accurate accounts and financial
            records of the supports delivered to NDIS Participants, along with
            records of all Service Agreements. All financial records relating to
            NDIS service delivery must accurately detail the quantity, type and
            duration of support delivered.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Agreements</h3>
          <p>
            Service Agreements are not mandatory and Participants are free to
            decline an offer to enter into a Service Agreement with Wagtail
            Services. If this occurs, a member of the Leadership Team will
            communicate to the Participant the benefits of entering into a
            Service Agreement. If the Participant still declines, reasons will
            be sought and these will be recorded. If a Service Agreement is to
            be developed, staff must work collaboratively with the Participant
            and their supports to develop Service Agreements that promote
            Participant goals and choice and control over both their supports
            and finances.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must disclose all fees and charges to Participants before
            providing supports and include this information in Service
            Agreements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Service Agreements must clearly set out the fees to be paid for
            supports, when delivery of supports is to be performed and the
            method of payment required for those supports. See Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and Procedure for more
            information about Service Agreements and what they must contain.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Bookings</h3>
          <p>
            Service Bookings apply to Participants whose NDIS funding is managed
            by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) or a registered
            NDIS Plan Manager. Service bookings formalise the supports to be
            provided to individual Participants in the NDIS myplace portal and
            contain key information from the Service Agreement, including the
            supports to be delivered, the period supports are required and the
            cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Directors, or authorised employees, are responsible for entering
            and managing all Wagtail Services service bookings for NDIA-managed
            Participants.
          </p>

          <h3>Payment</h3>
          <p>
            Once supports have been delivered to Participants whose funds are
            managed by the NDIA, the Director or authorised employee is
            responsible for submitting payment requests through the myplace
            portal, against the relevant Service Bookings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Payment requests are processed fortnightly. Payment requests must be
            submitted within 60 days from the end of the relevant Service
            Booking.
          </p>

          <p>
            Statements are issued to all NDIA-managed Participants or their
            nominated person fortnightly to provide them with regular summaries
            of supports delivered and fees charged for those services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should Wagtail Services experience any issues with payment requests,
            they can refer to the NDIAâ€™s provider toolkit at
            <a href="https://www.ndis.gov.au/">www.ndis.gov.au</a> or phone the
            Agency on 1800 800 110.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once supports have been delivered to a Participant who is
            self-managing their funding, the Participant or their nominated
            person will be invoiced directly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once supports have been delivered to a Participant who engages a
            registered Plan Manager, the Plan Manager will be issued an invoice
            so that they can process it on the Participantâ€™s behalf.
          </p>

          <p>
            Invoices are processed fortnightly. Invoice requests must be
            approved and submitted to an authorised employee before invoices are
            processed. Copies of invoices for self-managed and plan-managed
            Participants will be sent to the Participant or their nominated
            person for their information.
          </p>

          <h3>Record keeping</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services must comply with the NDIAâ€™s Provider Payment
            Assurance Program, which confirms the accuracy of payment requests
            submitted by registered providers. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              recording details of all supports provided and fees charged. At a
              minimum, this includes recording the Participantâ€™s name, date/s
              and total hours or quantity of the support delivered and the
              support type; and
            </li>
            <li>
              maintaining records that provide evidence of the supports
              provided. Records that must be kept include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Service Agreements containing the schedule, cost, type and
                  quality of supports to be delivered as well as the expected
                  outcomes for the Participant;
                </li>
                <li>approved quotes (where relevant); and</li>
                <li>
                  evidence of the amount of support provided and the type of
                  support provided.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Provider Payment Assurance Program section of the NDIS Provider
            Toolkit (see www.providertoolkit.ndis.gov.au) provides further
            detail about the records that should be kept for different support
            types.
          </p>

          <p>
            Financial records and accounts relating to NDIS service provision
            must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of issue.
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ recordkeeping must also comply with all relevant
            legislation and requirements detailed in Schedule 1, Legislative
            References.
          </p>

          <h3>Debtor Management</h3>
          <p>
            Where someone has difficulty paying fees, they are encouraged to
            discuss this with Wagtail Services so that mutually acceptable
            payment arrangements can be put in place.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outstanding debts relating to self-managed or fee-for-service
            supports are reviewed fortnightly by the manager, who arranges for
            contact with people who have fees that are 14 and 28 days overdue.
            The following approach will be taken at each point:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              14 days â€“ courtesy reminder phone call or message and follow up
              email or letter;
            </li>
            <li>
              28 days - courtesy reminder phone call or message and follow up
              email or letter. The Directors will consider terminating services
              based on the outcome, or devise a payment plan.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All contacts relating to outstanding debts, payments that are made
            and extensions or payment plan arrangements put in place as a result
            of following up debtors must be recorded. All agreements made with
            debtors or decisions made by the Directors / Manager must also be
            communicated in writing to the debtor after verbal contact.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to referring a debt to a debt collection agency or process,
            the Directors / Manager must first determine whether this is a
            financially worthwhile option for Wagtail Services.
          </p>

            processes.
