          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <p>
            Policies, procedures, and practices are in place to actively prevent
            violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, or discrimination. A
            safeguarding incident management system is maintained that is

          <h3>Incident Management</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each participant, staff member, volunteer, and contractor is
            safeguarded by the provider’s incident management system, ensuring
            that incidents are acknowledged, responded to, well-managed, and
            learned from.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <p>
            The incident management system complies with the National Disability
            Insurance Scheme (Incident Management and Reportable Incidents)

            been managed. Continuous improvement in incident management is
            achieved through regular review of policies, procedures, causes,
            handling, outcomes of incidents, and incorporation of feedback.

          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>Involvement of Children and Young People</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services regularly seeks the views of children and young
            people and encourages their participation in decision-making,
            including on safety and wellbeing issues.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services regularly reviews opportunities for children and
            young people’s participation and welcomes feedback from children,
            young people, their carers or family, staff and other stakeholders.
          </p>

          <h3>Recruitment and Induction</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services takes all reasonable steps to employ skilled people
            to work with children and young people. Wagtail Services develops
            selection criteria and advertisements that clearly demonstrate
            Wagtail Services’ commitment to child safety and an awareness of
            Wagtail Services’ social and legislative responsibilities. Wagtail
            Services understands its ethical and legislative obligations when
            recruiting staff.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services actively encourages applications from Aboriginal
            and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people from culturally and
            linguistically diverse backgrounds and people with a disability.
          </p>

          <p>
            All people engaged in child-related work, including volunteers, are
            required to hold a Working with Children Check and to provide
            evidence of this Check. Wagtail Services carries out reference
            checks and police record checks to ensure that it recruits the right
            people. See Wagtail Services’ Human Resources Policy and Procedure
            for more information on this process.
          </p>

          <p>
            If during the recruitment process a person’s records indicate a
            criminal history, the person will be given the opportunity to
            provide further information and context before a decision is made
            about their suitability to work with Wagtail Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services provides induction training for all staff and
            volunteers on their child safety and wellbeing responsibilities, the
            organisation’s child safety and wellbeing policy and procedure,
            external reporting obligations (mandatory reporting) and the Code of
            Conduct.
          </p>

          <h3>Training and Supervision</h3>

          <p>
            Training and education are important to ensure that everyone in
            Wagtail Services understands that child safety is everyone’s
            responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ culture aims for all staff (in addition to
            parents/carers and children and young people) to feel confident and
            comfortable in discussing any allegations of child abuse or child
            safety concerns.
          </p>

          <p>Wagtail Services trains staff on the following topics:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>

            wellbeing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services supports staff through ongoing supervision to
            develop their skills to protect children and young people from
            abuse, to promote the cultural safety of Aboriginal and Torres
            Strait Islander children and young people, the cultural safety of
            children and young people from linguistically and/or diverse
            backgrounds, and the safety of children and young people with a
            disability.
          </p>

          <p>
            New employees will be supervised regularly to ensure they understand
            Wagtail Services’ commitment to child safety and that everyone has a
            role to play in protecting children and young people from abuse, as
            well as checking that their behaviour towards children and young
            people is safe and appropriate (please refer to Wagtail Services’
            Staff Code of Conduct to understand appropriate behaviour further).
          </p>

          <p>
            Any inappropriate behaviour will be reported through appropriate
            channels, depending on the severity and urgency of the matter. See
            Wagtail Services’ Participant Incident Management Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>
          <h3>Fair Procedures for Staff</h3>

          <p>
            The safety and wellbeing of children and young people is Wagtail
            Services’ primary concern. Wagtail Services is also fair and just to
            staff. The decisions Wagtail Services makes when recruiting,
            assessing incidents, and undertaking disciplinary action will always
            be thorough, transparent, and based on evidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services records all allegations of abuse and safety
            concerns as per its Incident Management policies and procedures. All
            records are securely stored, as per Wagtail Services’ Records and
            Information Management Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            If an allegation of abuse or a safety concern is raised, Wagtail
            Services will provide updates to children and young people and
            families on progress and any actions the organisation takes (without
            compromising the privacy and confidentiality of its staff and
            ensuring they are supported also).
          </p>

          <h3>Privacy</h3>

          <p>
            All personal information considered or recorded will respect the
            privacy of the individuals involved, whether they be staff,
            volunteers, parents or children and young people, unless there is a
            risk to someone’s safety.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services has processes in place to seek parental and
            children and young people’s consent for relevant activities and
            information gathering (where appropriate).
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services has safeguards and practices in place to ensure any
            personal information is protected. Everyone is entitled to know how
            this information is recorded, what will be done with it, and who
            will have access to it, as per Wagtail Services’ Privacy and
            Confidentiality Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Risk Management</h3>

          <p>
            In addition to general occupational health and safety risks, Wagtail
            Services proactively manages risks of abuse to children and young
            people accessing its services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services has risk management strategies in place to
            identify, assess, and take steps to minimise child abuse risks,
            which include risks posed by physical environments (for example, any
            doors that can lock), and online environments (for example, no staff
            member is to have contact with a child supported by the organisation
            on social media). These strategies will be documented in Wagtail
            Services’ Risk Management Plans, as per its Risk Management Policy
            and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Allegations, Concerns, and Complaints</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services takes all allegations concerns and complaints
            seriously and has practices in place to investigate them thoroughly
            and quickly. Wagtail Services’ staff are trained to deal
            appropriately with allegations, concerns and complaints.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services works to ensure all children and young people,
            families and staff know what to do and who to tell if they observe
            abuse or are a victim, and if they notice inappropriate behaviour.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services staff and stakeholders all have a responsibility to
            report an allegation of abuse if they have a reasonable belief that
            an incident took place. Factors contributing to reasonable belief
            may be:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a child states they or someone they know has been abused (noting
              that sometimes the child may in fact be referring to themselves);
            </li>
            <li>
              behaviour consistent with that of an abuse victim is observed;
            </li>
            <li>
              someone else has raised a suspicion of abuse but is unwilling to
              report it; and
            </li>
            <li>observing suspicious behaviour.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>

            Procedure for more information.
