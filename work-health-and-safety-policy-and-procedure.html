          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>
          <h4>Risk Management</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Risks to Participants, workers and the
            provider are identified and managed.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Risks to the organisation, including risks to Participants,
              financial and work health and safety risks, and risks associated
              with provision of supports are identified, analysed, prioritised
              and treated.
            </li>
            <li>
              A documented system that effectively manages identified risks is
              in place and is relevant and proportionate to the size and scale
              of the provider and the scope and complexity of supports provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support delivery is linked to a risk management system, which
              includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Incident Management;</li>
                <li>Complaints Management;</li>
                <li>Work Health and Safety;</li>
                <li>Human Resource Management;</li>
                <li>Financial Management;</li>
                <li>Information Management; and</li>

          <h4>Safe Environment</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Each Participant accesses supports in a
            safe environment that is appropriate to their needs.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Where supports are provided in the Participant’s home, work is
              undertaken with the Participant to ensure a safe support delivery
              environment.

            If a staff member does experience an injury or illness, Wagtail
            Services is committed to the safe and durable return of the injured
            worker and will:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              participate in the development of a return to work/suitable duties
              plan and ensure that injury management commences as soon as
              possible after the staff member is injured;
            </li>
            <li>
              support the injured staff member and ensure that early return to
              work is a normal expectation;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide meaningful suitable duties that are based on medical
              advice as soon as possible;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure that injured staff (and anyone representing them) are aware
              of their rights and responsibilities – including the right to
              choose their own doctor, and the responsibility to provide
              accurate information about the injury and its cause;
            </li>
            <li>
              consult with staff to ensure that the return to work program
              operates as smoothly as possible; and
            </li>
            <li>
              maintain the confidentiality of injured staff members and their
              records.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Participants, their families and carers (with the
            support of staff where needed), are responsible for ensuring that
            their actions, or failure to act, does not intentionally put
            themselves, staff or others at risk (without compromising the
            Participant’s rights).
          </p>

          <p>
            Where a Participant experiences an injury or illness in connection
            with the supports provided by Wagtail Services, Wagtail Services has
            in place a Participant Incident Management Policy and Procedure and
            will protect and uphold Participant rights in accordance with this
            policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services has a goal to provide a safe and healthy work
            environment that is free from workplace injury and illness. This can
            only be achieved through the honest participation, co-operation and
            commitment of everyone working together.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>
          <h3>General</h3>

          <p>
            All WHS issues must be reported to the Manager, who will address or
            respond to the issue, or nominate a suitable staff member to do so.
            Staff can report safety concerns to the Manager via email or other
            electronic method, or by completing an Incident Report Form.
            Participants can raise potential safety concerns with their support
            worker (who can then escalate if necessary), via email, or by
            submitting a Feedback, Compliments and Complaints Form.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager must track the progress and outcomes of all WHS issues
            raised in Wagtail Services’ Risk Register. Where relevant, issues
            should also be included in the Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager reports WHS matters to the Leadership Team monthly. All
            high-risk concerns (for instance, where there is immediate risk of
            death or serious injury) must be escalated to the Leadership Team
            immediately so that control measures can be implemented.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services identifies and manages workplace hazards and risks
            to health and safety in line with its Risk Management Policy and
            Procedure. For incident reporting and investigation procedures, see
            Wagtail Services’ Workplace Incident Reporting and Participant
            Incident Reporting policies and procedures. Emergency Procedures are
            set out in Wagtail Services’ Emergency Planning Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>

          <h4>Leadership Team Responsibilities</h4>

          <p>The Leadership Team must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              make this policy available to all Staff and draw their attention
              to it in an effective manner;
            </li>
            <li>
              keep up to date and comply with changes in WHS legislation and
              practices and ensure these are communicated to staff, Participants
              and others where relevant;
            </li>
            <li>
              assign designated staff who are responsible for WHS functions and
              activities;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure staff are provided with adequate training in Safe Work
              Procedures and are informed of known hazards to their health and
              wellbeing that are associated with the work they perform;
            </li>
            <li>
              support access and provide information to inspectors, authorised
              representatives or staff who are acting within their powers under
              WHS legislation; and
            </li>
            <li>
              allocate appropriate resources to control any identified risk.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Manager’s Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            The Manager is responsible for overseeing Wagtail Services’ WHS
            functions and activities. They must ensure that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>there are safe systems of work in place;</li>
            <li>
              all equipment provided for use by workers is safe and meets
              relevant safety standards;
            </li>
            <li>
              substances and equipment are used, handled, and stored safely;
            </li>
            <li>
              there are adequate welfare facilities available for workers, such
              as first aid kits;
            </li>
            <li>
              Wagtail Services holds all appropriate licenses, registrations and
              permits, where required under WHS legislation;
            </li>
            <li>
              every reasonable effort is made to resolve WHS issues with workers
              or their representatives within a reasonable timeframe; and
            </li>
            <li>
              safety audits and risk assessments of Wagtail Services’ workplaces
              are undertaken regularly to prevent injuries and incidents
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Staff Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            WHS responsibilities and accountabilities will be included in all
            Position Descriptions. Staff are expected to uphold these at all
            times when performing duties for or when representing Wagtail
            Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon commencement, all staff must undergo initial training and
            orientation that includes general and task-specific WHS training.
            Staff are expected to participate in ongoing formal and on-the-job
            training provided by Wagtail Services as required. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff must provide appropriate health and safety information,
            instruction, training and supervision to all Participants, families,
            carers and other people in the workplace and ensure those people are
            not exposed to health and safety risks arising from Wagtail
            Services’ activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must also take responsibility for their own safety and the
            safety of others who could be affected by their actions. They must
            cooperate with all reasonable WHS rules and practices implemented by
            Wagtail Services and contribute to reviews of this policy and
            procedure.
          </p>
          <h3>Responsibilities of Participants, Families, Carers and Others</h3>
          <p>
            Participants, families, carers and other people in Wagtail Services’
            workplaces are expected (with the support of staff where required)
            to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>be familiar with this policy and procedure;</li>
            <li>
              cooperate with all reasonable WHS rules and practices implemented
              by Wagtail Services, including providing all relevant personal
              information and allowing relevant risk assessments to be
              undertaken; and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure their actions or failure to act do not put themselves,
              staff or others at risk.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Issue Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services will take all reasonable steps to consult and
            collaborate with workers to resolve potential or reported health and
            safety risks that may affect them. Wagtail Services also
            acknowledges that sometimes health and safety matters that are
            raised cannot be immediately resolved or actions agreed to mitigate
            the risk.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where a health and safety matter has been reported to Wagtail
            Services and it remains unresolved, the following Issue Resolution
            process can be followed.
          </p>

          <p class="textCenter">
            <img src="images/issueResolution.jpg" alt="Issue Resolution" />
          </p>
          <h3>Reporting</h3>

          <p>
            WHS hazards or risks should be identified, managed and reported in
            accordance with Wagtail Services’ Risk Management Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Incidents or injuries relating to WHS issues should be reported in
            accordance with Wagtail Services’ Incident Management policies and
            procedures.
          </p>
          <h3>Risk Assessments</h3>
          <p>
            The following approach should be taken when conducting a risk
            assessment in relation to a possible workplace health and safety
            hazard:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              conduct the risk assessment objectively - gather all available,
              relevant information, data and research about the hazard;
            </li>
            <li>
              include staff and/or Participants who work with, or may be
              directly impacted by the hazard, in the risk assessment process –
              risk assessments should be a team effort;
            </li>
            <li>
              consider all possible control options, based on the Hierarchy of
              Control, as outlined in Wagtail Services’ Risk Management Policy
              and Procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              document the risk assessment, including who was involved in the
              risk assessment, the nature of the hazard(s), the current controls
              and any proposed treatments in the Risk Assessment Form
            </li>
            <li>
              assign any proposed/future treatments to a responsible Manager and
              agree on a date that the action can be reasonably completed;
            </li>
            <li>
              regularly review the progress of treatment actions to ensure they
              are completed, or if they cannot be completed to determine an
              alternate strategy to reduce the risk; and
            </li>
            <li>
              provide the Risk Assessment to the Manager so that it can be
              entered and tracked in Wagtail Services’ Risk Register.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For additional guidance in conducting risk assessments and some
            practical advice for managing risks for staff working in
            Participant’s homes, the Guidance Material “A guide to working
            safely in people’s homes” (2018) from Workplace Health and Safety
            Queensland may be helpful (noting it can be applied across all
            States and Territories):

          </p>
          <h3>Working in Participant’s Homes</h3>
          <p>
            Where supports are to be provided in a Participant’s home, the
            Participant Risk Assessment and Home Risk Assessment must be
            completed, monitored and reviewed (see Wagtail Services’ Risk
            Management Policy and Procedure).
          </p>
          <p>
            A Participant’s home can change between visits. Changes may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>positioning of furniture;</li>
            <li>inoperable electrical equipment;</li>
            <li>people or animals are now present;</li>
            <li>altered storage patterns;</li>
            <li>spills or leaks;</li>
            <li>new equipment or furniture; and</li>
            <li>obstructed access.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Staff must determine at each visit the safety of the Participant’s
            home as a workplace before commencing their duties. This includes
            undertaking a visual scan of the home immediately on arrival, and of
            any equipment to be used, before use.
          </p>
          <p>Participants and/or their supporters are responsible for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              maintaining a safe work environment for staff (for example, repair
              broken steps, mow long grass, restrain animals, provide adequate
              lighting);
            </li>
            <li>
              looking after their own in-home safety (for example, maintaining
              electrical equipment and installing smoke alarms and safety
              switches to switchboards);
            </li>
            <li>
              cooperating with staff to ensure they can work in a safe way (for
              example, moving furniture to allow adequate work space);
            </li>
            <li>
              keeping their equipment safe, well maintained and in good order;
              and
            </li>
            <li>informing staff of any known hazards.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Working in a shared living environment</h3>
          <p>
            All staff working in Supported Independent Living services will
            receive instruction in how to manage the risks associated with
            delivering services in a shared living environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Leadership Team will conduct risk assessments and management
            plans for Supported Independent Living services, and amend policies
            and procedures where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Leadership Team will review risks and incidents on a monthly
            basis, and refer any issues identified for inclusion in the
            Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>
          <h3>Remote or Isolated Work</h3>
          <p>
            Remote or isolated work is when a staff member may be isolated from
            help from other people because of where or when they are working, or
            the nature of the work they are doing. For example, they may be
            working in locations or at times where it would be difficult for
            them to be rescued, get medical assistance or be reached by
            emergency services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Workers also face additional risks if nobody else is around to help
            with difficult tasks, alert them to hazards, give a second opinion
            about how to safely do a task, or notice if they are fatigued.
          </p>

          <p>
            A worker may be isolated even if other people are close by, for
            example a community nurse carrying out clinical visits at night.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must manage the risks associated with remote or
            isolated work. This is particularly important should a staff member
            require medical assistance, rescue or emergency services. Exposure
            to violence and poor access to emergency assistance are the main
            hazards that increase the risk of remote or isolated work.
          </p>
          <h3>Manual Handling</h3>
          <p>
            Manual Handling is related to the physical aspects of work, and
            injuries can occur from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>using repetitive or ongoing force;</li>
            <li>using or having sudden force;</li>
            <li>repetitive movements;</li>
            <li>
              prolonged holding in one position, or awkward postures; and/or
            </li>
            <li>exposure to vibration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Manual Handling injuries can also be a result of moving objects or
            handling people, either over an extended period of time (gradual
            wear and tear), or due to a sudden incident. Wagtail Services will
            identify potential manual handling risks in consultation with staff
            and Participants and implement management plans to reduce the risk
            of injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participant Home Risk Assessments will also help to identify
            potential manual handling risks and strategies to prevent them
            specific to each Participant. The Manager will ensure that staff
            working with each Participant are informed of any potential manual
            handling issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services will provide Manual Handling training to staff
            whose role includes manual handling of Participants, initially and
            then annual refresher training. This will include strategies for
            safely handling people for support staff who are required to help
            with Participant mobility.
          </p>
          <h3>Workplace Violence</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services proactively works to prevent and reduce violence in
            the workplace, including when working in a Participant’s home or in
            the community. The Leadership Team will conduct risk assessments in
            relation to situations that may expose workers to the risk of
            violence, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              providing services to Participants who have challenging behaviours
              that may be related to a medical condition or intellectual
              impairment, as long as it is within the scope of Wagtail Services;
            </li>
            <li>performing work alone and/or in isolated environments; and</li>
            <li>
              working in an environment where other people may pose a risk to
              workers’ personal security (e.g. Participant’s family and
              friends).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In conjunction with Wagtail Services’ Participant Risk Assessment
            and Home Risk Assessment, where a Participant has been identified as
            having challenging behaviour, specific strategies and mitigations to
            reduce the risk of violence will be clearly outlined in their
            Support Plan. Wagtail Services will ensure that staff are provided
            with de-escalation and avoidance strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            All injuries or incidents relating to violence must be reported –
            including abuse and threats, in accordance with Wagtail Services’
            Workplace Incident Management Policy and Procedure.
          </p>
          <h3>Work Related Stress</h3>
          <p>
            Work related stress can be commonly experienced when working with
            vulnerable people or people with high or complex needs. Work related
            stress refers to the physical, mental and emotional reactions of
            workers when they perceive that their work demands are greater than
            their abilities and/or their resources (such as time/ help /
            support). Stress responses can occur when the worker perceives they
            are not coping in situations where it is important to them that they
            do.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Leadership Team will conduct risk assessments to identify
            potential sources of occupational stress. These might include (but
            are not limited to):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>rates of absenteeism;</li>
            <li>staff engagement/morale;</li>
            <li>peak/seasonal demands;</li>
            <li>incident reports and data trends;</li>
            <li>exit interviews of past staff; and</li>
            <li>client feedback.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Risk assessments must also consider risk factors. These might
            include (but are not limited to):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>excessive workload from supervisors/managers;</li>
            <li>clients or others in the workplace;</li>
            <li>lack of clarity about their role;</li>
            <li>
              exposure to emotionally distressing situations or incidents that
              may threaten their wellbeing;
            </li>
            <li>emotional attachment to a terminally ill client; and</li>
            <li>poor support from managers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services will implement control measures to prevent work
            related stress in consultation with its workers.
          </p>
          <h3>Biological Hazards</h3>

          <p>
            Exposure to biological hazards can cause serious illness to workers,
            with potential for infections and other health complications. To
            reduce exposure and risk from contact with biological hazards,
            Wagtail Services has in place specific infection prevention and
            control strategies, refer to Wagtail Services’ Infection Control
            Policy and Procedure.
          </p>
          <h3>Safe Work Procedures</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will develop Safe Work Procedures (SWPs) in
            consultation with workers and based on risk assessment. SWPs will be
            reviewed regularly to ensure the documented processes are current,
            accurate and meet legislative requirements. Staff will be provided
            training in Wagtail Services’ SWPs at induction and when they are
            changed/updated.
          </p>
          <h3>Personal Protective Equipment</h3>

          <p>
            Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) provides protection to workers
            from possible harm or illness hazards they may be in contact with.
            The use of PPE does not change the nature of the risk and is
            considered a ‘last line of defence’. Wagtail Services will provide
            the necessary PPE required to safely perform job tasks, based on
            risk assessment and in consultation with workers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must use appropriate PPE when necessary that is suitable for
            the nature and degree of the identified hazard. For tasks involving
            hazardous chemicals, the PPE recommended in the Safety Data Sheet
            (SDS) must be used.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must be trained in the proper selection, fitting, storage and
            maintenance of PPE. Training will be provided by Wagtail Services at
            induction.
          </p>

          <h3>Electrical Safety</h3>

          <p>
            Electrical work is not to be undertaken on Wagtail Services premises
            except by an appropriately licensed Electrical Installation worker
            engaged by the Manager. This work must be completed by a licenced
            electrician or an appropriately trained staff member or contractor.
          </p>

          <h3>Testing, Tagging and Repairing Electrical Equipment</h3>

          <p>
            The inspection, testing and tagging of electrical equipment used at
            Wagtail Services premises must be conducted for all equipment that
            is in use. Equipment not in use and/or beyond its testing date
            should be removed from service, and an isolation tag applied noting
            that tagging is required and must be completed prior to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            Testing and tagging of equipment must be done either by a qualified
            electrician or by someone who has successfully completed an approved
            course at a Vocational Education and Training provider. There are
            also a number of electrical contractors who specialise in the
            checking and tagging of electrical equipment. Electrical appliances
            must be inspected and tested:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              at intervals not exceeding those set out by AS3760:2010 (a
              tolerance of two weeks is acceptable); and
            </li>
            <li>
              before being returned to service or after any repair or servicing
              that could have affected the electrical safety of the appliance.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Manufacturer's instructions may specify intervals appropriate to
            specific types of equipment.
          </p>
          <h3>New Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            Brand new electrical equipment that is ‘out of the box' and unused
            (i.e. new equipment that is not second-hand) does not have to be
            tested before first use, but should still be visually inspected to
            ensure that no damage occurred during transport, delivery,
            installation or commissioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The date when the new electrical item was placed into service should
            be recorded, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>that the equipment is ‘new to service';</li>
            <li>the date of entry into service; and</li>
            <li>the date when the first electrical safety test is due.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Any equipment purchased second-hand must be tested and tagged before
            first use.
          </p>
          <h3>Appliances Brought in from Home</h3>
          <p>
            Electrical appliances brought in from home by staff, or by
            contractors, Participants or volunteers, for use on Wagtail Services
            premises are subject to the same testing and tagging procedures as
            for appliances owned or leased by Wagtail Services. Appliances
            should be tested and tagged prior to their use on Wagtail Services
            property.
          </p>

          <p>
            While there is no requirement to test and tag personal
            computers/laptops, staff, Participants and volunteers are encouraged
            to have their laptops tested and tagged using an approved person or
            company.
          </p>

          <p>
            In both situations above the testing and tagging is the
            responsibility and at the expense of the owner.
          </p>
          <h3>Hire Equipment</h3>

          <p>
            While it is the responsibility of the person hiring equipment to
            ensure that the equipment is inspected and tested at the
            commencement of each hire, the person or company who hires out the
            equipment to Wagtail Services must ensure that the equipment - for
            the period of the hire - meets all relevant inspection and testing
            requirements.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Electrical Equipment and Appliances in Participant’s Homes,
            including SIL
          </h3>

          <p>
            While electrical equipment in a private residence does not have to
            be tested and tagged, Wagtail Services staff must still visually
            inspect any electrical equipment or appliance prior to use to ensure
            that it is not damaged, cords are not frayed and the item is in good
            working order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any electrical item that is broken or damaged must not be used, and
            the Participant or their supporters/family informed so it can be
            repaired or replaced. If appropriate, it is recommended that the
            item is removed from use.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Use of Electrical Portable Outlet Devices on Wagtail Services
            Premises
          </h3>
          <p>
            The use of double adaptors is not permitted within Wagtail Services
            premises and should be removed and replaced with Electrical Portable
            Outlet Devices (EPODs), also known as power boards, fitted with
            overload protection devices. Ensure that any power boards are
            installed securely and in a location that is not susceptible to
            damage or exposure to water and have adequate ventilation. Where
            possible, power boards should be placed on their side to prevent
            dust build up in unused points. Each power board must be plugged
            into a general purpose outlet (GPO). Be aware too many EPODs plugged
            into GPOs on the same circuit may overload the circuit and cause a
            power failure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must regularly check that all plugs are firmly fixed into the
            power board and look for any signs of damage/fraying. Any power
            boards that are broken or not working must be removed from use and
            replaced. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Extension leads are only suitable for temporary applications. For
            longer term applications a new GPO should be installed or an EPOD
            with overload protection used. Ensure the extension lead is placed
            appropriately and shielded with an appropriate extension lead cover
            to reduce tripping hazards. Be wary of heavy equipment rolling over
            or impacting the lead as it may damage the insulation and wires
            causing shorting.
          </p>

          <h3>Unsafe Electrical Equipment at the Workplace</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager will ensure that any unsafe electrical equipment is
            disconnected (or isolated) from its electricity supply and, once
            disconnected, is not reconnected until it is repaired or tested and
            found to be safe or is replaced or permanently removed from use.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure that unsafe electrical equipment is not used inadvertently
            before it can be tested, repaired or replaced, it should immediately
            be tagged to indicate that it has been taken out of service for
            safety reasons pending testing and possible repair and to warn
            against further use.
          </p>

          <p>
            An Incident Report should be lodged when the hazard is discovered
            and include all details of the incident to enable accurate
            investigation.
          </p>
          <h3>Electrical Hazard and Incident Reporting</h3>

          <p>
            All hazards and injuries relating to electrical safety must be
            reported immediately in accordance with Wagtail Services’ Incident
            Management Policies and Procedures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most electrical shocks constitute a notifiable incident and must be
            dealt with in accordance with Wagtail Services’ Workplace Incident
            Management Policy and Procedure.
          </p>
