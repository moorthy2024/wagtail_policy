          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant requiring complex bowel care receives appropriate
            support relevant (proportionate) to their individual needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Each participant is involved in the assessment and development of
              the plan for their complex bowel care management. With their
              consent, the participantâ€™s health status is subject to regular and
              timely review by an appropriately qualified health practitioner.
              The plan identifies how risks, incidents and emergencies will be
              managed, including required actions and escalation to ensure
              participant wellbeing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Appropriate policies and procedures are in place, including a
              training plan for workers, that relate to the support provided to
              each participant receiving complex bowel care.
            </li>
            <li>
              All workers working with a participant requiring complex bowel
              care have received training, relating specifically to each
              participantâ€™s needs, type of complex bowel care and high intensity
              support skills descriptor for providing complex bowel care,
              delivered by an appropriately qualified health practitioner or
              person that meets the high intensity support skills descriptor for
              complex bowel care.

          <h2>Background and Definitions</h2>

          <h3>General Medical Information:</h3>

          <p>
            Complex bowel care involves comprehensive management of bowel
            functions for individuals with severe disabilities or health
            conditions that impair their ability to maintain normal bowel
            function. This may include individuals with spinal cord injuries,
            severe neurological disorders, or other conditions that affect
            gastrointestinal mobility and control. Complex bowel care is vital
            for preventing complications such as constipation, impaction, bowel
            obstruction, and fecal incontinence. Effective management requires a
            holistic approach, considering factors like diet, fluid intake,
            medication, and regular bowel routines.
          </p>
          <h3>Definitions:</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Complex Bowel Care:</strong> Specialized care and
            interventions required for managing bowel health in individuals with
            disabilities or severe health conditions. It includes assessment,
            planning, and implementation of tailored bowel management
            strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Constipation:</strong> A common bowel issue characterized by
            infrequent or difficult bowel movements. In the context of complex
            care, it may require interventions such as medication, dietary
            adjustments, or manual removal techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fecal Incontinence:</strong> The inability to control bowel
            movements, leading to unintentional loss of stool. Management may
            include dietary modifications, bowel routine scheduling, and
            specific continence aids.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bowel Routine: </strong>A structured schedule of
            interventions (like diet, medication, and toileting) designed to
            maintain regular bowel movements and prevent complications.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Suppositories: </strong>Medications inserted rectally to
            stimulate bowel movements or administer specific medication for
            local action in the rectum.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Enemas:</strong> The introduction of fluid into the rectum
            and colon to stimulate a bowel movement, often used in cases of
            severe constipation or preparation for medical procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Manual Evacuation: </strong>The physical extraction of stool
            from the rectum, used in situations of severe constipation or fecal
            impaction where softer methods are ineffective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Neurogenic Bowel:</strong> Dysfunction of the bowel due to a
            neurological condition or spinal cord injury, affecting regular
            bowel function and control.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Colostomy/Ileostomy Care:</strong> Management of a surgical
            opening (stoma) in the abdomen for waste elimination due to various
            medical conditions, requiring specific care techniques and
            monitoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Digital Stimulation:</strong> A method used to induce bowel
            movement by gently stimulating the anal sphincter and lower rectum,
            often used in neurogenic bowel management.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Laxatives:</strong> Substances that soften stools or
            stimulate bowel movements, used in managing constipation. They come
            in various forms like oral, rectal, and systemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bowel Obstruction: </strong>A serious condition where there
            is a blockage preventing the passage of intestinal contents. It may
            require urgent medical intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Peristalsis: </strong>The wave-like muscle contractions in
            the intestines that propel contents forward, essential for normal
            bowel movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fecal Impaction:</strong> A severe form of constipation
            where stool hardens and collects in the rectum and lower colon,
            often requiring manual removal or specific medical interventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Stool Softeners:</strong> Medications used to soften the
            stool consistency, making it easier to pass and reducing the risk of
            constipation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bowel Training:</strong> A program to help re-establish
            normal bowel movements, often involving scheduled toilet times,
            dietary changes, and sometimes medication.
          </p>

            medication review.
          </p>

          <p>
            Develop a bowel care plan in collaboration with multidisciplinary

          </p>

          <h3>Staff Training and Requirements:</h3>

          <p>
            Develop a structured training curriculum covering anatomy,

          </p>

          <p>
            Develop emergency protocols for scenarios like severe constipation,
            bowel obstruction, or rectal bleeding.
