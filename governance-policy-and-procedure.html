            (proportionate) to the size and scale of the provider and the scope
            and complexity of supports delivered.

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Leadership Team is made up of the Directors (who
            may act in a managerial capacity – sharing managerial
            responsibilities with an appointed Manager), Manager and Senior
            Support Workers. The Leadership Team meets regularly (fortnightly to
            monthly). An Agenda is circulated prior to every meeting and Minutes
            are kept by a member of the Leadership Team or by an Administrative
            Worker. Leadership Team meetings cover service provision, financial,
            data, IT and service quality information (including incidents and
            Participant feedback and complaints).
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail has introduced Visualcare as our client record management
            system.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recognising that Participant input to governance improves service
            outcomes, Wagtail Services involves them in its governance processes
            where possible. This may include involving them in service delivery
            and planning days and/or certain Leadership Team meetings (see
            Wagtail Services’ Feedback and Complaints Policy and Procedure).
          </p>

          <h3>Leadership Team Qualifications, Training and Development</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services must be managed by suitably qualified and
            experienced people with clearly defined responsibilities, authority
            and accountability for the provision of supports to Participants.
          </p>

          <p>
            Collectively, the Leadership Team must have the qualifications and
            experience to meet Wagtail Services’ financial, legislative,
            regulatory and contractual responsibilities, and to monitor and
            respond to quality and safeguarding matters associated with
            delivering NDIS supports to Participants.
          </p>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Services’ Human Resources Policy and Procedure, all
            Leadership Team members must receive initial and ongoing training,
            be offered development opportunities and participate in annual
            performance reviews, to support continuous improvement in Wagtail
            Services’ management practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Directors will monitor the skills and knowledge required for the
            Leadership Team to effectively govern Wagtail Services and ensure
            they undertake relevant training to address any gaps.

            improvement.
