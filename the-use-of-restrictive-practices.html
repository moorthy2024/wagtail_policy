        <div class="content">
          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

          <p>
            In the past, restrictive practices were often used as a first
            response to behaviours that caused significant harm to a person or
            others. It is now recognised that restrictive practices can
            represent serious human rights infringements.
          </p>

          <p>
            The purpose of this policy and procedure is to ensure the safety of
            the participants in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ care, support the delivery of
            high quality services to participants by improving their quality of
            life and reducing or eliminating behaviours of concern, minimise and
            prevent any physical harm within the service, and ensure restrictive
            practices are only used in accordance with this document and
            relevant legislation.
          </p>

          <p>
            It applies to all potential and existing participants who may
            receive restricted practices and their family members, carers and
            other supporters, as well as all staff of Wagtail Services. It meets
            relevant legislation, regulations and Standards as set out in
            Schedule 1, Legislative References.

            observations, and information to develop an understanding of the
            relationship of events and circumstances that trigger and maintain
            the behaviour.

            <strong>Independent Specialists </strong>- a pool of qualified
            behaviour support practitioners managed by the New South Wales
            Government to support the operation of Restrictive Practice
            Authorisation (RPA) Panels within NDIS Registered Providers that are
            using restrictive practices.

            <strong>Positive Behaviour Support </strong>â€“ an evidenced-based
            approach to managing behaviours of concern that incorporates ongoing
            functional assessments and person-centred interventions to assist
            with improving an individualâ€™s quality of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Restrictive Practice </strong>â€“ any practice or intervention
            that has the effect of restricting the rights or freedom of movement
            of a person with disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Regulated Restrictive Practice </strong>â€“ any Restrictive
            Practice that is or involves any of the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Chemical Restraint </strong>â€“the use of medication or a
            chemical substance for the primary purpose of influencing a personâ€™s
            behaviour. It does not include the use of medication prescribed by a
            medical practitioner for the treatment of, or to enable treatment
            of, a diagnosed mental disorder, a physical illness or a physical
            condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Environmental Restraint</strong> â€“ restricting a personâ€™s
            free access to all parts of their environment, including items or
            activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mechanical Restraint</strong> â€“ the use of a device to
            prevent, restrict, or subdue a personâ€™s movement for the primary
            purpose of influencing a personâ€™s behaviour. It does not include the
            use of devices for therapeutic or non-behavioural purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Physical Restraint</strong> â€“ the use or action of physical
            force to prevent, restrict or subdue movement of a personâ€™s body, or
            part of their body, for the primary purpose of influencing their
            behaviour. Physical restraint does not include the use of a hands-on
            technique in a reflexive way to guide or redirect a person away from
            potential harm/injury, consistent with what could reasonably be
            considered the exercise of care towards a person.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Seclusion</strong> â€“ the sole confinement of a person with
            disability in a room or a physical space at any hour of the day or

            NOTE: Restrictive Practices do not include the following Prohibited
            Practices:

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Overcorrection</strong> â€“ any practice where a person is
            required to respond disproportionately to an event, beyond that
            which may be necessary to restore a disrupted situation to its
            original condition before the event occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Misuse of medication</strong> â€“ administration of medication
            prescribed for the purpose of influencing behaviour, mood or level
            of arousal, contrary to the instructions of the prescribing general
            practitioner, psychiatrist or other specialist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Seclusion of children or young people </strong>â€“ isolation

            which they are unable to leave for the duration of a particular
            crisis or incident.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            <strong>Unauthorised use of a restrictive practice</strong> â€“ the

            have validity or does not adhere to requisite protocols and
            approvals.
          </p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services is committed to providing positive behaviour
            support for participants that is appropriate to their needs,
            incorporates evidence-based practice and maintains the dignity and
            rights of the participant. All positive behaviour support principles
            will be used with consideration of the participantâ€™s rights and
            ethical requirements, regardless of the existence of behaviours of
            concern.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will ensure restrictive practices are only used
            when necessary and where the primary purpose of that intervention is
            to protect a person with a disability or others from harm. They will
            be used only as a last resort, in the least restrictive manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will ensure that each participant is only subject
            to restricted practices that are reported to the NDIS Commission,
            authorised by the NSW Government and comply with the National
            Disability Insurance Scheme (Restrictive Practices and Behaviour
            Support) Rules 2018. Restrictive practices will be ceased at the end
            of the authorised period, or as soon as they are no longer required
            or approved.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will ensure that each participant that is subject
            to an emergency or unauthorised use of a restrictive practice has
            that practice recorded and reviewed.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>
          <p>
            Staff must talk to participants who display behaviours of concern,
            and (with their consent), their support network and other service
            providers, about the need for restrictive practices and the risks
            associated with them. At all times, alternatives to using
            restrictive practices should be promoted in these discussions.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a participant does not have a supporter or guardian and is unable
            to advocate for themselves, staff must ensure the person is
            supported to access an advocate (see Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Decision
            Making and Choice Policy and Procedure).
          </p>

          <p>
            All evaluation, feedback and data collected by Wagtail Services in
            relation to participantâ€™s behaviour support plans will be aimed at
            determining strategies for the ongoing reduction of restrictive
            practices. When positive change is reported through feedback and
            evaluation, this will be used as an opportunity to reduce
            restrictive practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must help staff, participants, families, and
            decision-makers understand the NDIS Commissionâ€™s behaviour support
            function.
          </p>

          <h3>Staff Training, Development and Support</h3>

          <p>
            The support workers implementing behaviour support plans must
            maintain up-to-date knowledge and understanding of positive
            behaviour support, restricted practices and regulated restrictive
            practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must not use restrictive practices without appropriate
            training in the safe use of the restriction, the legal framework and
            obligations that apply to its use, and the risks posed by the use of
            the restriction. The Manager must ensure staff have this training
            and be satisfied of their competence in the practice prior to its
            use.
          </p>

          <p>
            See Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Positive Behaviour Support Policy and
            Procedure and Human Resources Policy and Procedure for further
            detail on training and support to be provided to staff in this area.
          </p>

          <h3>Behaviour Support Plans</h3>

          <p>
            Where a participantâ€™s behaviours of concern require staff to take a
            positive behaviour support approach, but do not require the use of
            restrictive practices, a behaviour support plan should be developed.
            Where a participantâ€™s behaviours of concern place themselves or
            others at risk of harm, and a regulated restrictive practice is
            required to help manage this, a behaviour support plan must be
            developed.
          </p>

          <p>Behaviour support plans should clearly contain, as a minimum:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>what the participantâ€™s strengths are;</li>
            <li>why the participant displays challenging behaviour;</li>
            <li>
              how the environment must be changed to make challenging behaviour
              unnecessary;
            </li>
            <li>
              specific approaches and strategies to teach the participant new
              skills, making their reliance on challenging behaviours
              unnecessary;
            </li>
            <li>what the objectives of the behaviour support plan are; and</li>
            <li>
              how relevant people in the participantâ€™s life will contribute to
              the implementation of the plan.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Behaviour Support Plan Development</h3>

          <p>
            The decision to develop a Behaviour Support Plan for a participant
            must be based on recommendation by a behaviour support practitioner,
            psychologist, medical/allied health specialist, or other behaviour
            support professional.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where an immediate need for a behaviour support plan is identified,
            an Interim Behaviour Support plan must be developed within one
            month, using the NDIS Commissionâ€™s Behaviour Support Practitioner â€“
            Interim Behaviour Support Plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should an Interim Behaviour Support Plan be required in response to
            an incident relating to the use of a restrictive practice, Wagtail
            Services will collaborate with relevant mainstream services such as
            the Police, other emergency services, mental health and emergency
            departments, treating medical practitioners and other allied health
            clinicians to contribute to the planâ€™s development.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Comprehensive Behaviour Support plan must be developed within six
            months of the need for a plan being identified, using the NDIS
            Commissionâ€™s Behaviour Support Practitioner â€“ Comprehensive
            Behaviour Support Plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff implementing either type of behaviour support plan developed
            by another Registered Specialist Behaviour Support Provider must be
            included in and support the development of the plan. This includes
            agreeing upon clear responsibilities relating to its implementation
            and review. Staff should also assist the behaviour support
            practitioner to gather the necessary information for the functional
            behavioural assessment and other assessments required to develop the
            plan.
          </p>

          <h3>Registering Plans with the NDIS Commission</h3>

          <p>
            All behaviour support plans that contain restrictive practices must
            be registered with the NDIS Commission by the Registered Specialist
            Behaviour Support Provider responsible for developing the plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the relevant behaviour support plan has been approved, it must
            be emailed to behavioursupport@ndiscommission.gov.au. Once the plan
            is received, the NDIS Commission will:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              advise all implementing service providers that the plan has been
              lodged;
            </li>
            <li>
              request implementing providers to submit details of consent and
              authorisation once these are obtained; and
            </li>
            <li>
              provide implementing providers with the NDIS Commissionâ€™s
              Restrictive Practices Reporting form.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Consent</h3>

          <p>
            Informed consent must be obtained from the participant or their
            guardian to implement their behaviour support plan. Specific consent
            requirements for regulated restrictive practices are detailed in the
            NSW Restrictive Practices Authorisation Policy.
          </p>

          <h3>Authorisation</h3>

          <p>
            Behaviour support plans that contain regulated restrictive practices
            must also be approved in accordance with the relevant state
            authorisation process. In New South Wales, there are three
            requirements for the use of a regulated restrictive practice:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>A behaviour support plan is developed;</li>
            <li>
              Informed consent is obtained by the participant or their guardian;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              Authorisation is approved by a Restrictive Practices Authorisation
              Panel.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            All behaviour support plans that contain regulated restrictive
            practices must be approved by an RPA Panel convened by the
            Registered Specialist Behaviour Support Provider responsible for
            developing the plan. Wagtail Services must have documentary evidence
            that behaviour support plans have been registered with the NDIS
            Commission and been authorised by an RPA Panel, prior to
            implementing them.
          </p>

          <p>
            If authorisation is not provided by the RPA Panel, the behaviour
            support practitioner will need to review the plan with the
            participant, their support network and implementing providers. Any
            use of a regulated restrictive practice that requires authorisation
            that has not been obtained constitutes a reportable incident.
          </p>

          <h3>Behaviour Support Plan Implementation</h3>

          <p>
            When implementing behaviour support plans, the behaviour support
            practitioner in charge of the plan must ensure the participant, and
            (with their consent) their support network and other service
            providers, are provided with a rationale of the behaviour support
            planâ€™s strategies and are trained in its effective implementation.
            This should include but is not limited to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>person-focused training;</li>
            <li>coaching and mentoring; and</li>
            <li>ongoing support for implementing the strategies.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Manager will ensure that the participantâ€™s consent, and any
            documentation relating to substitute decision makers, guardians, or
            appointed Public Guardians are readily accessible to support staff
            members in the implementation of the behaviour support plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            When implementing Interim Behaviour Support Plans, Wagtail Services
            must evaluate all risks posed to the participant and others, and
            ensure the Interim plan appropriately mitigates these risks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff implementing a behaviour support plan developed by another
            Registered Specialist Behaviour Support Provider must:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              actively work with the relevant behaviour support practitioner to
              implement the plan and align support delivery with
              evidence-informed practice and positive behaviour support; and
            </li>
            <li>
              where necessary, collaborate with other providers that work with
              the participant to implement strategies in their behaviour support
              plan.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff involved in implementing positive behaviour strategies or
            restrictive practices must have received appropriate training.
            Wagtail Services will proactively support specialist behaviour
            support providers to train staff in the use and monitoring of
            behaviour support strategies in behaviour support plans, including
            positive behaviour support, to ensure effective implementation of
            participantsâ€™ plans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must notify the NDIS Commission of situations where
            effective engagement with other service providers implementing
            behaviour support plans is not possible, and if support provided to
            participants is not implemented in accordance with their behaviour
            support plans.
          </p>

          <h3>Use of Restrictive Practices</h3>

          <p>
            Restrictive practices will not be used by staff unless Wagtail
            Services has detailed procedures in place that detail the specific
            application of the restriction (e.g. how physical restraint will be
            safely and legally applied in the relevant setting) and staff have
            been trained on these procedures by the Registered Behaviour Support
            Practitioner who developed the procedures.
          </p>

          <p>For a regulated restrictive practice to be used, it must:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              be clearly identified in the participantâ€™s behaviour support plan;
            </li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Behaviour Support Plan Monitoring and Review</h3>

          <p>
            To support Wagtail Servicesâ€™ continuous improvement approach to
            support delivery, on an ongoing basis, staff must monitor and
            evaluate the progress and effectiveness of the strategies in
            behaviour support plans. They should do this by regularly engaging
            with participants and their support networks and by monitoring the
            data provided by other service providers. This can occur through
            informal processes such as obtaining feedback from participants or
            reviewing case notes, or formal meetings such as team meetings,
            supervision, and stakeholder meetings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Comprehensive Behaviour Support Plans must be formally reviewed, at
            a minimum, every twelve months. More frequent reviews may be
            undertaken based on feedback from the participant and through
            monitoring behaviour support data and changes in the participantâ€™s
            behaviour. Reviews are also required if participants move to or from
            New South Wales or change service providers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Further, there may be circumstances where a behaviour support plan
            is developed before suitable providers to implement the plan are
            found. In this situation, the plan will need to be reviewed when
            providers are found.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reviews must be undertaken by a behaviour support practitioner, with
            contributions from staff involved in implementing the plan. The
            primary focus of reviews should be reducing or eliminating
            restrictive practices based on observed progress or positive changes
            in the participantâ€™s situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Modifications to behaviour support plans should be based on feedback
            from participants, their support networks and other stakeholders, as
            well as evaluation of participantsâ€™ behaviour. Amended behaviour
            support plans must be registered with the NDIS Commission,
            authorised by an RPA Panel and communicated to all parties involved
            in implementing the plan, as per the procedures set out above.
          </p>

          <p>
            The NDIS Commission may also review behaviour support plans through
            random audits or based on complaints or other information it
            receives.
          </p>

          <h3>Reporting</h3>

          <p>
            All approved behaviour support plans must be lodged online through
            the NDIS Commission Portal by the Registered Specialist Behaviour
            Support Provider responsible for developing the plan. Positive
            behaviour support plans that do not include restrictive practices do
            not need to be lodged.
          </p>

          <p>
            All restrictive practices used with participants must be reported to
            the NDIS Commission on a monthly basis, via the NDIS Commission
            Portal, using the Restrictive Practices Reporting form. If there
            have been no uses of a restrictive practice in the reporting period,
            a NIL response still needs to be reported to the NDIS Commission.
          </p>

          <p>
            The requirement to report restrictive practices to the NDIS
            Commission does not replace existing obligations to report to other
            relevant authorities, including child protection agencies or Police.
          </p>

          <h3>Reportable Incidents</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must report the unplanned or unapproved use of a
            restrictive practice to the NDIS Commission as a reportable
            incident.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reportable incidents involving restrictive practices must be managed
            and reported in accordance with the National Disability Insurance
            Scheme (Incident Management and Reportable Incidents) Rules 2018 and
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Participant Incident Management Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will ensure appropriate support is given to relevant
            stakeholders and the participant when a reportable incident occurs
            while providing support through a behaviour support plan that
            includes restrictive practices. This includes ensuring participants
            involved in reportable incidents are immediately referred to a
            medical practitioner for assessment where necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following a reportable incident, Wagtail Services will collaborate
            with relevant mainstream services such as the Police, other
            emergency services, mental health and emergency departments,
            treating medical practitioners and other allied health clinicians to
            ensure the incident is effectively responded to.
          </p>

          <p>
            When an unauthorised restrictive practice is used, staff involved in
            the use, along with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Manager and other relevant
            providers, must debrief to identify areas for improvement and to
            inform the proper use of future behaviour management strategies. The
            minutes and outcomes of these meetings must be documented.
          </p>

          <p>
            All reportable incidents must also be reviewed (as per Wagtail
            Servicesâ€™ Participant Incident Management Policy and Procedure).
            Outcomes of reviews must inform a review of the relevant behaviour
            support plan and where required, the supports provided to the
            impacted participant. If required, supports provided to the
            participant must be adjusted.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the participant did not have a behaviour support plan, a
            behaviour support practitioner may need to develop one for them. If
            a behaviour support plan was in place, the behaviour support
            practitioner should review the participantâ€™s behaviour support plan
            to ensure it is adequate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should a new behaviour support plan be required, it must be subject
            to the same registration and authorisation processes as described
            above before being implemented.
          </p>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Participant Incident Management Policy and
            Procedure, the participant, and (with their consent) their support
            network, will be involved in the review of reportable incidents that
            impact them, including where they involve the use of an unauthorised
            restrictive practice.
          </p>

          <h3>Interim authorisation in response to a critical incident</h3>

          <p>
            In exceptional circumstances, restrictive practices may need to be
            rapidly implemented in response to situations where there is a clear
            and immediate risk of harm linked to behaviours of concern, when
            there is no behaviour support plan in place. As with restrictive
            practices generally, these restrictive practices should involve the
            minimum amount of restriction or force necessary, the least
            intrusion and be implemented only for as long as is necessary to
            manage the risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these circumstances, interim authorisation for the use of
            restrictive practices is required pending the development of a
            behaviour support plan and authorisation by an RPA Panel. This
            should be sought as soon as practicable and within one month.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager or a senior manager of a Registered Specialist Behaviour
            Support Provider can provide this interim authorisation and an
            Interim Behaviour Support Plan can be put in place. A Comprehensive
            Behaviour Support Plan must be developed within six months.
          </p>

          <h3>Record Keeping</h3>

          <p>
            Information and data collected and recorded by behaviour support
            practitioners and support workers must comply with the National
            Disability Insurance Scheme (Restrictive Practices and Behaviour
            Support) Rules 2018, Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Use of Restrictive Practices
            Policy and Procedure and Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Records and Information
            Management Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will keep a record of all participants with a
            behaviour support plan, recording all uses of restrictive practices
            and reportable incidents in relation to the use of restrictive
            practices. This must be reviewed monthly at each Leadership Team
            meeting.
          </p>

          <p>Information that must be recorded includes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a description of the use of the regulated restrictive practice,
              including:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the impact on the person with disability or another person;
                </li>
                <li>
                  any injury to the person with disability or another person;
                </li>
                <li>
                  whether the use of the restrictive practice was a reportable
                  incident; and
                </li>
                <li>why the restrictive practice was used;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              a description of the behaviour of the person that lead to the use;
            </li>
            <li>
              the time, date and place at which the use of the practice started
              and ended;
            </li>
            <li>
              the names and contact details of the people involved in the use;

            <li>actions taken in response to the use;</li>
            <li>
              any less restrictive options considered or used before using the
              restrictive practice; and
            </li>
            <li>
              any actions taken leading up to the use, including any strategies
              used to prevent the need for the use of the practice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Records must be kept for seven years from the day the record is
            made.

          <h2>Monitoring and Review</h2>

          <p>
            This policy and procedure will be reviewed at least annually, or
            following any significant incident, by the Leadership Team. Reviews
            will incorporate participant and other stakeholder feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will regularly review and monitor processes related
            to positive behaviour support and protecting participants and other
            people from harm, based on its Internal Review and External Audit
            Schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ feedback collection mechanisms, such as
            participant satisfaction surveys, will assess:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              participant and other stakeholder awareness of their rights and
              the extent to which they feel able and supported to exercise them;
            </li>
            <li>
              participant and other stakeholder satisfaction with Wagtail
              Servicesâ€™ complaints processes; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the extent to which participants feel safe and protected in their
              dealings with Wagtail Services.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Continuous Improvement Register will be used to
            record identified improvements and monitor the progress of their
            implementation. Where relevant, this information will be considered
            as part of Wagtail Servicesâ€™ service planning and delivery
            processes.
