            <li>to outside agencies with the personâ€™s permission;</li>
            <li>with written consent from someone with lawful authority; or</li>
            <li>
              when required by law, or to fulfil legislative obligations such as
              mandatory reporting.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If a staff member is in a situation where they believe that they
            need to disclose information about a Participant or other staff
            member that they ordinarily would not disclose, they must consult
            the Manager before making the disclosure.
          </p>

          <h3>Reporting</h3>

          <h3>Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme</h3>

          <p>
            The Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme is a national scheme that
            operates under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). requires organisations to
            report certain data breaches to people impacted by the breach, as
            well as the Australian Information Commissioner.
          </p>

          <p>
            A data breach occurs when personal information about others is lost
            or subject to unauthorised access. A data breach may be caused by
            malicious action, human error or a failure in information management
            or security systems.
          </p>

          <p>Examples of data breaches include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              loss or theft of devices (such as phones, laptops and storage
              devices) or paper records that contain personal information;
            </li>
            <li>
              unauthorised access to personal information by a staff member;
            </li>
            <li>
              inadvertent disclosure of personal information due to â€˜human
              errorâ€™, for example an email sent to the wrong person; and
            </li>
            <li>
              disclosure of an individualâ€™s personal information to a scammer,
              as a result of inadequate identity verification procedures.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In addition to harm caused to people who are the subject of data
            breaches, an incident like this may also cause Wagtail Services
            reputational and financial damage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Further detail about the NDB Scheme is contained in the Data Breach
            Preparation and Response â€” A Guide to Managing Data Breaches in
            Accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), published by the Office
            of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).
