          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this policy and procedure is to set out how risks to
            Participants (including children), staff and Wagtail Services are
            identified and managed. It applies to all staff and meets relevant
            legislation, regulations and standards as set out in Schedule 1,
            Legislative References.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incident Management and Work Health and Safety are dealt with in
            separate policies and procedures specific to these areas.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Risk Management</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Risks to Participants, workers and the
            provider are identified and managed.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Risks to the organisation, including risks to Participants,
              financial and work health and safety risks, and risks associated
              with provision of supports are identified, analysed, prioritised
              and treated.
            </li>
            <li>
              A documented system that effectively manages identified risks is
              in place and is relevant and proportionate to the size and scale
              of the provider and the scope and complexity of supports provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support delivery is linked to a risk management system which
              includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Incident Management;</li>
                <li>Complaints Management;</li>
                <li>Work Health and Safety;</li>
                <li>Human Resource Management;</li>
                <li>Financial Management;</li>

          <h2>Definitions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Event:</strong> occurrence or change of a particular set
              of circumstances. An event can have one or more occurrences, and
              can have several causes and several consequences. An event can
              also be something that is expected and does not happen, or
              something that is not expected and does happen. An event can be a
              risk source.

              <strong>Consequence:</strong> outcome of an event affecting
              objectives. A consequence can be certain or uncertain, can have
              positive or negative direct or indirect effects on objectives.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk:</strong> any internal or external situation or event
              that has the potential to have an impact (either positive or
              negative) on people associated with the organisation, the
              organisation successfully achieving its outcomes and delivering
              its services, the organisationâ€™s viability or its reputation. From
              a Risk Management perspective, risk is the combination of the
              likelihood (chance) of an event occurring and the consequences
              (impact) if it does.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <u>Managed Risk</u> - the level of risk remaining after risk
                  treatment plans have been put in place and are being followed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Unmanaged Risk</u> - The level of risk before any action
                  has been taken to manage it.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Risk Analysis:</strong> the process to understand the
              nature, sources and causes of risks to determine the degree of
              risk. The degree and consequences of risk together inform risk
              evaluation and decisions about risk treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> the overall process for
              identifying, analysing and evaluating risks. Risk assessments
              assist in determining:
              <ul>
                <li>what levels of harm can occur;</li>
                <li>how harm can occur; and</li>
                <li>the likelihood that harm will occur.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk Evaluation:</strong> The process of determining
              whether a risk is tolerable or whether it requires â€˜risk
              treatmentâ€™.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk Identification:</strong> the process of finding,
              recognising and describing risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk Treatment:</strong> a measure, work process or system
              used to eliminate a risk, or if this is not possible, reduce the
              risk so far as is practicable. Options include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <u>Avoiding the Risk</u> â€“ where the level of risk is
                  unacceptable, and the means of risk control are either not
                  viable, not worthwhile or not actionable, risk could be
                  eliminated by not proceeding with the activity that could
                  generate the risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Changing the Risk Consequence</u> â€“ undertake actions aimed
                  at reducing the impact of the risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Changing the Risk Likelihood</u> â€“ undertake actions aimed
                  at reducing the probability of the risk occurring.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Retaining or Accepting the Risk</u> â€“ Accept the risk as it
                  is. This is appropriate where:
                  <ul>
                    <li>it is not possible to treat the risk;</li>
                    <li>it is uneconomic to treat the risk; or</li>
                    <li>the risk level is tolerable.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Sharing the Risk</u> â€“ Responsibility for treating the risk
                  can be transferred or allocated to other parties best able to
                  manage it. For example, using insurers.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services takes its responsibility to identify and manage all
            types of organisational risks very seriously. Risk management is
            incorporated into all areas of its operations and the system is
            appropriate to the businessâ€™ size and the classes of NDIS supports
            it provides.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ approach to risk management is based on Australian
            and International Standard AS ISO 31000:2018 (Risk Management
            Guidelines) and deals with how an organisation approaches,
            identifies, treats and manages organisational risks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Directors and Manager are ultimately responsible
            for the risk management process. However, all staff are expected to
            act responsibly to minimise risks to themselves and others, and
            report hazards and other risks as soon as they are identified.
          </p>
          <h2>Procedures</h2>
          <h3>General</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Leadership Team is responsible for showing
            leadership and commitment in its risk management approach. This
            includes monitoring and reviewing Wagtail Servicesâ€™ risk management
            practices to ensure they are appropriate to the organisationâ€™s
            needs, in consultation with staff, Participants and other
            stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>Leadership Team members must:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              support risk management in all areas of Wagtail Servicesâ€™
              operations;
            </li>
            <li>have clear accountability, ownership and governance;</li>
            <li>
              be responsive, systematic, transparent and consistent in the risk
              management approach;
            </li>
            <li>support evidence-based decision-making;</li>
            <li>
              include effective and regular consultation and communication with
              relevant stakeholders;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure staff understand their risk management responsibilities;
            </li>
            <li>foster a positive, risk-aware culture; and</li>
            <li>facilitate regular reviews and continual improvement.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All staff must support Wagtail Services in risk management, and are
            expected to help identify, analyse, treat, monitor and report risks
            in their areas of responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Risks are to be monitored and reviewed based on their potential
            severity and likelihood â€“ those risks with greater impact/higher
            risks would be monitored and reviewed more frequently than low
            impact/low risks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Communication and consultation is key to having a robust risk
            management system. Wagtail Services will include relevant key
            stakeholders in the risk assessment and management process, as well
            as providing regular information back to Participants, staff and/or
            stakeholders about risks that may affect them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Risk Management Approach is based on the following
            steps, where
            <strong>communication, consultation, monitoring </strong>and
            <strong>review</strong>
            occurs throughout the process:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Understand.</strong> What is the scope, background,
              criteria for the risk management process. Use Wagtail Servicesâ€™
              Risk Assessment Form to document the risk assessment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conduct Risk Assessment: Identify.</strong> Identify risks
              that relate to the business, for instance, risks to Participants,
              financial risks, market risks, reputational risks, and risks
              associated with providing NDIS supports.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conduct Risk Assessment: Analyse.</strong> Outline the
              causes, impacts and existing treatments related to each risk
              identified, in order to determine a Risk Rating. Risk Ratings are
              based on an assessment of the likelihood of the risk occurring and
              the likely consequences faced by the business/Participants/staff
              should the risk occur.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conduct Risk Assessment: Treat.</strong> Identify one or
              more Risk Treatments for each risk identified and implement
              existing and future treatments to prevent or mitigate the risk.
              The treatment/s should be relative to the nature and seriousness
              of the risk and what can be reasonably done based on the business'
              resources.

              <strong>Record and Report.</strong> Record identified risks in the
              Risk Register when the Risk Control Plan is complete, and update
              the register any time there is a change. Report information about
              the risks and actions to Management, staff, Participants and other
              stakeholders at quarterly intervals (or when things change).

          <h3>Identifying Risks</h3>
          <p>
            To complete a thorough risk assessment, it is necessary to consider
            a range of possible events or risks that may occur. When identifying
            potential risks, Wagtail Services will take into account a variety
            of factors depending on the type of risk being assessed, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>physical or non-physical sources;</li>
            <li>threats and opportunities;</li>
            <li>strengths and weaknesses;</li>
            <li>indicators of emerging risks;</li>
            <li>
              knowledge and reliability of known information (or lack of);
            </li>
            <li>effects of time;</li>
            <li>nature and value of assets and resources; and/or</li>
            <li>biases, assumptions and experiences of those involved.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Risk Analysis and Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            To analyse identified risks, Wagtail Services will use the following
            consequences definitions relevant to the category of risk being
            assessed. As part of determining the consequences and likelihood, it
            is important to consider the worst outcome most likely to occur, not
            the absolute worst possible outcome.
          </p>

            Once the consequence and likelihood have been determined using the
            above matrices, the following Risk Matrix provides the overall risk
            rating. Once risks have been evaluated, the risk rating provides
            Wagtail Services with the ability to prioritise risk actions
            according to the potential severity. Very high risks (e.g. 1A)
            require immediate attention and escalation to the Directors and
            should not proceed until the risk can be mitigated. Very low risks
            (e.g. 5E) are lowest priority.

          <h3>Treating Risks â€“ Hierarchy of Control</h3>
          <p>
            Treating or controlling risks will be based on the following order
            of preference, taking into account the nature and potential severity
            of the risk.

          </p>
          <h3>Organisational Risks</h3>
          <p>
            The Directors and manager are responsible for identifying and
            managing organisational risks in their area of influence. They must
            conduct regular Risk Assessments in consultation with staff,
            Participants, and relevant stakeholders, covering at least the
            following areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Incident Management;</li>
            <li>Complaints Management;</li>
            <li>Child Safety and promoting a Child Safe Environment;</li>
            <li>
              Work Health and Safety, including with respect to Wagtail
              Servicesâ€™ supported independent living services;
            </li>
            <li>Human Resource Management;</li>
            <li>Financial Management;</li>
            <li>Information Management;</li>
            <li>Governance; and</li>
            <li>Business Continuity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Directors and manager are responsible for ensuring all people
            and equipment associated with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ operations are
            covered by appropriate insurances. See Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Financial
            Management Policy and Procedure for more detail.
          </p>
          <h3>Risks to Staff</h3>
          <p>
            All staff are responsible for managing risk within their work
            environment. Upon commencement, all staff will undergo initial
            training and orientation, which will include risk management
            training appropriate to their role. Additional on-the-job and formal
            training will be provided where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            Team meetings and supervision sessions are ideal opportunities for
            managers and staff to reflect on person-centred risk management
            practice. Wagtail Services includes Risk Management as part of its
            Agenda for any staff meetings, to increase risk awareness and to
            discuss any potential risks that have been identified.
          </p>

          <p>
            Operational risks and risks to staff must be reported to the
            Directors or Manager as soon as practicable after they are
            identified. Identified risks will be tracked by the Directors and
            Manager using Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Risk Register.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must also be aware of their Work Health and Safety obligations
            and comply with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Work Health and Safety policies
            and procedures.
          </p>

          <h3>Risks to Participants</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services plays an important role in supporting Participants
            to manage risks on a daily basis. Staff must understand and abide by
            the following concepts when supporting Participants.
          </p>

          <h3>Foreseeable injury</h3>
          <p>
            When helping Participants access activities or situations, keep in
            mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              what is already known about the personâ€™s capacity to carry out
              similar activities safely;
            </li>
            <li>
              what is known about a personâ€™s awareness of what risks might be
              involved and of how to avoid them;
            </li>
            <li>
              what is known about the dangers involved in the activity and
              whether the person can deal with them; and
            </li>
            <li>
              what can be learnt from relevant assessments or reports about the
              personâ€™s abilities and skills.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Seriousness of the Injury</h3>
          <p>
            When considering the likelihood of an injury, keep in mind the
            potential seriousness of an injury, even where the likelihood of it
            occurring seems remote.
          </p>
          <h3>Doing what is reasonable to avoid injury</h3>
          <p>
            Consider courses of action that involve the least possible
            restriction on peopleâ€™s rights. When a personâ€™s rights are
            compromised to avoid injury, ensure the least important and fewest
            rights of the person are affected. Also ensure that compromises are
            being made to the rights of as few people as possible. Placing
            restrictions on people who are not affected by the issue is not
            reasonable.
          </p>
          <h3>Supporting people to face risks safely</h3>
          <p>
            Risks are part of life and an important means by which all people
            learn and develop. Consider ways of empowering people to take more
            control over, and responsibility for, situations including risks in
            their lives.
          </p>

          <p>
            This can be achieved by providing opportunities and support that
            assist the person to manage their own risks while avoiding harm.
          </p>
          <h3>Safeguarding others from injury</h3>

          <p>
            In addition to protecting Participants, Wagtail Services owes a duty
            of care to others, including members of the public, who might be
            injured by the actions of a Participant that Wagtail Services is
            supporting. It is important to consider the wider effects of a
            Participantâ€™s choices, not just how those choices may affect the
            Participant.
          </p>

          <h3>Participant Risk Assessments</h3>

          <p>
            A Participant Risk Assessment must be undertaken for all
            Participants at their initial assessment and reviewed during formal
            Support Plan reviews. Earlier reviews may be needed if there are
            changes to the personâ€™s environment or existing risks, or if new
            risks emerge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where supports are to be provided in a Participantâ€™s home, the
            Participant Risk Assessment will include a Home Risk Assessment. The
            purpose of a Home Risk Assessment is to identify potential hazards
            in the Participantâ€™s home and put appropriate controls in place to
            reduce the risk of injury or illness for staff, the Participant and
            others.
          </p>

          <p>
            The risk assessment process must identify appropriate Risk
            Treatments, which should also be reflected in the Participantâ€™s
            Support Plan. If either assessment shows that staff would be exposed
            to significant risks, the Manager must determine if supports should
            be modified or suspended until the risk has been adequately
            controlled.
          </p>

          <p>
            Risk assessments and risk reviews must be done in collaboration with
            Participants, their supporters, landlords (if applicable) and any
            other stakeholders involved in managing a specific risk.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enabling the person to achieve their lifestyle goals and have
            greater choice and control, more opportunity to try new things and
            develop skills must be considered. Risk assessments must also
            consider any incident reports that relate to the Participant and
            whether specialist positive behaviour support arrangements should be
            put in place or changed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff should raise any issues or concerns regarding Participant Risk
            Assessments with the Manager and significant risks should be
            escalated to the Leadership Team for further advice. Risk
            Assessments and reviews must be kept on Participant files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supervision between staff and managers is an opportunity to discuss
            Participantsâ€™ safety needs and concerns and actions the staff member
            is responsible for. Participantsâ€™ safety and wellbeing can also be
            discussed without disclosing the personâ€™s identity at team meetings,
            so all team members have the opportunity to learn from and
            contribute to different risk assessments.
          </p>

          <h3>Supporting Participants Through Service Provider Transition</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will work collaboratively with all Participants who
            are transitioning from its services to identify what alternative
            providers and referrals could best meet their needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the Participantâ€™s or their representativeâ€™s consent, relevant
            information will be provided by Wagtail Services to new service
            providers to support the Participant's seamless transition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where required, Wagtail Services staff will also meet with staff of
            alternative providers to facilitate a smooth transition for the
            Participant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similarly, Wagtail Services will work closely with Participants who
            are transitioning to Wagtail Services from other service providers,
            to make the change as smooth as possible. Wagtail Services will work
            collaboratively with the Participantâ€™s other service provider(s) to
            develop a comprehensive Participant Transition Plan. Further
            information about the Transition process can be obtained from the
            Participant Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and Procedure and
            Service Exit Policy and Procedure.
