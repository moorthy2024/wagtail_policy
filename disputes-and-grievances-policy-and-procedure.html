        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

            under this policy and procedure, however, from time to time staff
            may raise issues or provide feedback that is best dealt with under
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Feedback and Complaints Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Matters relating to Work Health and Safety will be generally be

            by workers who are competent in relation to their role, hold

            experience to provide person-centred support.
          </p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services is committed to maintaining positive working
            relationships between its staff and management. Disputes and
            grievances should be addressed within the organisation in a timely
            and confidential manner. The process requires respectful and honest
            discussion between both parties to reach a fair and reasonable
            outcome.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>General</h3>

          <p>
            Sometimes situations can arise where a worker honestly believes that
            a decision by Wagtail Services has been made that is unfair or
            unreasonable, or negatively affects them. Where the staff member, on
            reasonable grounds, feels that a decision is unjust, they can raise
            a grievance in accordance with this procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are some circumstances that a grievance may not be lodged, and
            these are covered in other relevant policies and procedures. This
            includes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              where the staff member has not already reasonably tried to resolve
              the matter with the person, or with their direct supervisor;
            </li>
            <li>a complaint about performance management of a staff member;</li>
            <li>the decision/s related to a Workers Compensation claim; and</li>
            <li>
              matters that have been or are undergoing investigation by an
              external authority.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Disputes and grievances must be treated by all parties with the
            utmost confidentiality, and the complainant must not be victimised.
          </p>

          <p>
            All grievances will be taken seriously and investigated in an
            impartial manner.
          </p>

          <h3>Disputes</h3>

          <p>
            Staff should attempt to resolve disputes with the other person
            before lodging a grievance. If attempts to resolve the dispute fail,
            staff must discuss the matter with the Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will mediate and seek an acceptable compromise for both
            parties. If the dispute involves their supervisor, the staff member
            must discuss the matter with the Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            Issues of sexual harassment or discrimination should be brought to
            the notice of the Manager as soon as practicable, for investigation
            in accordance with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Workplace Incident
            Investigation Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Formally Lodging Grievances</h3>

          <p>
            If a dispute cannot be resolved, the staff member should lodge a
            grievance in writing to the Manager.
          </p>

          <p>This should detail:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              description of the decision/s or behaviour/s that are the subject
              of the dispute;
            </li>
            <li>
              the manner in which the decision or behaviour has adversely
              affected the staff member;
            </li>
            <li>the time and date of the decision/s or behaviour/s;</li>
            <li>names of witnesses;</li>
            <li>attempts made to resolve the dispute; and</li>
            <li>
              the action the staff member deems necessary to resolve the
              grievance.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Investigating Grievances</h3>

          <p>
            Once a formal grievance is lodged, the Manager will investigate the
            matter within 5 working days.
          </p>

          <p>The following parties will be interviewed:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>the staff member who lodged the grievance;</li>
            <li>
              the staff member against whom the grievance has been lodged;
            </li>
            <li>any witnesses; and</li>
            <li>the relevant supervisor/s and/or manager/s.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All parties involved in the investigation will be given equal
            opportunity to explain the circumstances and describe the matter
            from their perspective. Interviews shall be conducted with
            procedural fairness and be unbiased. Interviews and issues raised
            through the investigation will be documented.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any person who is required to be interviewed as part of the
            investigation will be offered a support person to be present with
            them. The role of the support person is to provide emotional
            support; they are not able to answer any questions on behalf of the
            person they are supporting, or give their personal opinions, beliefs
            or perspectives. A support person cannot be another person who is
            involved in the investigation of the grievance.
          </p>

          <h3>Resolving Grievances</h3>

          <p>Where necessary, the Manager will:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              appoint an independent mediator to help resolve disputes; and
            </li>
            <li>
              encourage a support person, union or professional association
              representative in dispute resolution procedures.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the investigation reveals that the grievance is valid, and
            depending on the nature of the complaint and its seriousness, the
            staff member against whom the grievance was lodged may be:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              required to apologise to the staff member who lodged the
              grievance;
            </li>
            <li>given a warning, counselling, transfer or demotion;</li>
            <li>dismissed; or</li>
            <li>required to participate in further training.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the grievance cannot be substantiated because of a lack of
            evidence, or it is considered a vexatious complaint, Wagtail
            Services may:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              remind all staff of their obligations under the Code of Conduct
              and Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Equity, Anti-Discrimination and Workplace
              Harassment Policy and Procedure; and/or
            </li>
            <li>
              ask all staff to undertake training in negotiation skills and
              dispute resolution.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The outcome of the investigation</h3>

          <p>
            If the grievance is found to be a frivolous claim, and depending on
            the seriousness of the allegations, the staff member making the
            complaint may be:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              asked to undertake counselling or participate in further training;
            </li>
            <li>
              make a written apology to the staff member complained about;
            </li>
            <li>given a written warning, transfer or demotion; or</li>
            <li>dismissed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff have the right to appeal decisions relating to disputes.
            Appeals should be directed in writing to the Manager and a final
            decision will be made by the Director/Manager. Staff who
            successfully appeal will have the outcome and actions reassessed for
            appropriateness. Staff who are not successful in their appeal will
            have the original decision reconfirmed.
          </p>

          <p>
            A staff member who has raised a complaint or Wagtail Services may
            have the right to refer their complaint to an external party, such
            as the Fair Work Commission, if a resolution cannot be reached.
          </p>
