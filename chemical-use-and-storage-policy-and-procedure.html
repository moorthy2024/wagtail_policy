              use by a household consumer and used in a manner consistent with
              normal household use. Consumer products include small quantities
              of domestic cleaning products and detergents, as well as chemicals
              used in an office such as printer toner and whiteboard cleaners.
              Large volumes of these products, such as a 30kg container of
              laundry detergent used to wash large volumes of linen, are not
              considered a consumer product. They should be treated as hazardous

            <li>
              <strong>In-transit:</strong> hazardous chemicals are in-transit if
              they are not used in the workplace and are not kept at the
              workplace for more than five consecutive days. However, where the
              workplace frequently has in-transit hazardous chemicals present,
              or if they are present in significant quantities, they should be
              treated as a hazardous chemical for the purpose of this policy and
              procedure.

              <strong>Safety Data Sheet (SDS):</strong> a document that provides
              information about a hazardous chemical to ensure users can work
              safely with the substance. Information in SDSs includes the
              substance’s physical properties (e.g. melting/boiling point,
              toxicity, reactivity), health effects, first aid requirements and
              safe handling procedures (e.g. personal protective equipment, safe
              storage/disposal and spills management).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services ensures that when hazardous chemicals are
            introduced into Wagtail Services workplaces that they are recorded,
            handled and disposed of appropriately.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>Identifying Hazardous Chemicals</h3>
          <p>
            The Manager must ensure all hazardous chemicals are identified and
            clearly labelled or signed within the workplace.
          </p>
          <h3>Recording Hazardous Chemicals</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must ensure that details of all hazardous chemicals
            (other than in-transit or consumer products) used at Wagtail
            Services are recorded in a Chemical Register.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Chemical Register must be reviewed when new or additional
            quantities of chemicals are introduced into the workplace. Review is
            also required when the processes in place to protect people from
            harm from specific substances need to change or are no longer
            effective.
          </p>

          <h3>Handling Hazardous Chemicals</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must ensure Safe Work Procedures (SWPs) are developed
            and implemented for handling hazardous chemicals used by Wagtail
            Services. See Wagtail Services’ Work Health and Safety Policy and
            Procedure for more detail on developing SWPs.
          </p>

          <h3>Safety Data Sheets</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must maintain a hard copy collection of current Safety
            Data Sheets (SDSs) for all hazardous chemicals used by Wagtail
            Services. The SDS obtained for each chemical must be the current
            authorised version prepared by the manufacturer. SDS are valid for a
            period of 5 years, and the Directors will check currency at least
            annually.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Chemical Register and associated SDSs are to be kept by the
            Manager in a suitable location which is known and accessible to all
            staff in the workplace, as well as any other person who is likely to
            be exposed to the hazardous chemicals. SDS are a helpful reference
            as they contain information about:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              hazards of the chemical and how to handle it safely, including
              storage and disposal;
            </li>
            <li>
              physical and chemical properties of the chemical, as well as
              potential health and emergency response measures; and
            </li>
            <li>environmental effects of the chemical.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Health Surveillance</h3>
          <p>
            The Manager must regularly refer to and comply with health
            surveillance requirements set out in SDSs, to support the health and
            safety of staff exposed to hazardous chemicals.
          </p>

          <h3>Labelling Hazardous Chemicals</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must ensure all hazardous chemical storage containers
            are clearly labelled and in accordance with the Globally Harmonised
            System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Labels
            must remain intact, legible and unaltered. The receipt date for
            hazardous chemicals should be marked on their containers so staff
            can monitor their age and promote the use of older materials first.
          </p>

          <p>
            Containers with unknown substances in them should be labelled
            ‘CAUTION DO NOT USE: UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE’. Steps must then be taken to
            ascertain and label the contents, or if it cannot be identified,
            contact a local waste management authority to arrange for the
            substance’s safe disposal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Refer to Labelling of Workplace Hazardous Chemicals Code of Practice
            2011 (Qld) and SafeWork NSW’s Labelling of Workplace Hazardous
            Chemicals Code of Practice, April 2016 (NSW) for further guidance on
            labelling hazardous chemicals.
          </p>

          <h3>Storing Hazardous Chemicals</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must ensure that hazardous chemicals are stored
            appropriately and only with other compatible substances. It is
            important that incompatible chemicals are separated as they may
            ignite or explode, release toxic, flammable or corrosive gases, or
            corrode the container causing them to leak if mixed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Storage quantities should be kept to a minimum to cater for demand
            only. Excessive storage for long periods should be avoided to ensure
            the strength and integrity of the chemical is not compromised.
          </p>

          <h3>Signage</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must ensure that signage is put in place to provide a
            visual warning of any areas where hazardous chemicals are stored in
            large quantities.
          </p>

          <p>
            This includes ensuring that all purpose-built cupboards, cabinets
            and refrigerators are labelled to indicate the type and class of
            chemicals being stored in them. Additional warning signs may also be
            required, such as “DO NOT USE TO STORE FOOD”.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Storing Hazardous Chemicals in Supported Independent Living
            Environments
          </h3>

          <p>
            Participants living in Supported Independent Living (SIL)
            environments have the right to access all areas of their home.
            Hazardous chemicals cannot be stored securely in locked cupboards or
            rooms, because all areas of the home must be accessible to
            residents.
          </p>

          <p>
            As such, hazardous chemicals should not be kept in SIL environments.
            Domestic cleaning and other consumer products used in SIL
            environments should be non-toxic wherever possible. Where hazardous
            chemicals must be used in a SIL environment, it should be considered
            a last resort and the chemicals must be kept in small quantities in
            a hazardous storage cabinet (appropriate to the type of chemical
            e.g. flammable or corrosive).
          </p>

          <h3>Risk Management</h3>
          <p>
            In accordance with Wagtail Services’ Risk Management Policy and
            Procedure, the Manager must implement a risk management process
            regarding chemical use and storage. This includes actively
            identifying hazards and implementing risk controls to eliminate or
            reduce the risks associated with these hazards.
          </p>

          <h3>Emergency Procedures</h3>
          <p>
            In accordance with Wagtail Services’ Emergency Planning Policy and
            Procedure, the Wagtail Services must ensure appropriate emergency
            management provisions are in place to respond to incidents involving
            hazardous chemicals.
          </p>
          <p>These provisions may include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>spill kits or containment equipment;</li>
            <li>SWPs for spills or release of chemicals;</li>
            <li>fire blankets/extinguishers;</li>
            <li>first aid kits;</li>
            <li>
              eye wash stations/eye wash kits/emergency showers (where large
              quantities of chemical are stored);
            </li>
            <li>
              appropriate numbers of trained emergency wardens and first aiders;
              and
            </li>
            <li>clearly displayed emergency contact details.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Chemical Waste and Disposal of Chemicals</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must ensure hazardous chemical waste is disposed of as
            per Wagtail Services’ Waste Management Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Consultation, Information and Training</h3>
