          <p>
            The purpose of this policy and procedure is to set out Wagtail
            Services’ security arrangements, so that it can provide a safe and
            secure work and service delivery environment for staff,
            Participants, and others. It also outlines the ongoing requirements
            for maintaining the premises and any equipment in good condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            It applies to all staff and meets relevant legislation, regulations
            and Standards as set out in Schedule 1, Legislative References. It
            should be read in conjunction with Wagtail Services’ Work Health and
            Safety Policy and Procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            For processes relating to Participant and staff personal safety, see

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Risk Management</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Risks to Participants, workers and the
            provider are identified and managed.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Risks to the organisation, including risks to
              <strong>Participants</strong>, financial and
              <strong>work health and safety</strong> risks, and risks
              associated with provision of supports are identified, analysed,
              prioritised and treated.
            </li>
            <li>
              A documented system that effectively manages identified risks is
              in place and is relevant and proportionate to the size and scale
              of the provider and the scope and complexity of supports provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support delivery is linked to a risk management system which
              includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Incident Management;</li>
                <li>Complaints Management;</li>
                <li>Work Health and Safety;</li>
                <li>Human Resource Management;</li>

            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services ensures the safety and security of staff and
            visitors by implementing a variety of security measures in relation
            to its premises.
          </p>
          <p>
            The built and landscaped environments at Wagtail Services premises
            will be maintained to ensure that the facilities are adequate for
            the services provided, and allows safe and secure use by staff,
            Participants and other stakeholders.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>Entry to Premises</h3>
          <p>
            Entry to the Wagtail Headquarters is via a fob system. Staff are
            allocated fobs and the number recorded in the fob register.
          </p>

          <h3>Visitors</h3>
          <p>
            All visitors can only gain access if accompanied by a staff member.
          </p>

          <h3>Exit from Premises</h3>
          <p>
            The last staff member to leave Wagtail Services each day must turn
            off all the office lights and set the security system to ARMED.
          </p>

          <h3>General Premises Requirements</h3>
          <h4>Entry and Exit</h4>
          <p>
            Entries and exits must be clearly lit, slip-resistant, signed and
            clearly marked. Appropriate entries and exits must be available for
            mobile equipment, such as wheelchairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aisles and walkways must be at least 600mm wide, free of furniture
            and other obstacles, and where necessary, clearly marked. Staircases
            must be guarded with upper and lower rails, with a handrail on at
            least one side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Power-operated doors and gates must have safety features to prevent
            people being struck or trapped. They will also be suitably signed,
            to warn of potential hazards.
          </p>

          <h4>Work Areas</h4>
          <p>
            Staff must maintain good housekeeping practices and a tidy workplace
            at all times to reduce the risk of injury from slips and trips.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work areas must have enough space to allow someone to move about
            freely without strain or injury and evacuate quickly in the event of
            an emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where noise, heat or manual tasks are involved, a larger work area
            should be used where possible.
          </p>

          <h4>Floors and Other Surfaces</h4>
          <p>
            Floors must be slip resistant and free of any hazards, such as
            cables and loose tiles, which can cause slips or trips. Carpets or
            mats should be used in office areas and where staff are undertaking
            static standing work.
          </p>

          <h4>Lighting and Ventilation</h4>
          <p>
            There must be sufficient light to enable staff to perform tasks
            without straining their eyes or adopting awkward postures.
            Additional lighting should be used in areas of low lighting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal workplaces must be properly ventilated with windows and
            doors, fans or air-conditioning.
          </p>

          <h4>Extreme Temperatures</h4>
          <p>
            As far as practicable, the work and service delivery environment
            should be maintained between 20°C and 26°C.
          </p>

          <h4>Noise</h4>
          <p>
            The working environment and/or equipment in the workplace must not
            exceed the maximum noise levels recommended by the Standards
            Association of Australia. Noise is considered excessive when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              total (continuous) noise exceeds 85 dB when averaged over an
              8-hour period (known as 85dB(A); or
            </li>
            <li>
              noise that exceeds a peak noise level of 140 dB(C) at any time
              during the day.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Wagtail Services will actively aim to keep noise below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              50 dB(A) if the work requires high concentration or effortless
              conversation
            </li>
            <li>
              70 dB(A) if the work is routine, fast-paced and demands
              attentiveness, or if it is important to carry on conversations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Personal Facilities</h4>
          <p>
            Staff and visitors must have access to clean, safe and accessible
            toilets, drinking water, washing and eating facilities, and secure
            storage for personal items.
          </p>

          <h4>Specific Types of Work</h4>
          <p>
            Where staff, Participants or others are working or undertaking
            activities outdoors, they must have access to shelter for eating
            meals and taking breaks, and to protect themselves in adverse
            weather conditions. They must also have or be given personal
            protective equipment (PPE) for protection from the weather.
          </p>

          <h4>Working in Participant’s Homes</h4>
          <p>
            Where supports are to be provided in a Participant’s home, the
            Participant Risk Assessment and Home Risk Assessment must be
            completed, monitored and reviewed (see Wagtail Services’ Risk
            Management Policy and Procedure).
          </p>

          <p>
            A Participant’s home can change between visits. Changes may include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>furniture positioning;</li>
            <li>faulty electrical equipment;</li>
            <li>people or animals being present;</li>
            <li>altered storage patterns;</li>
            <li>spills or leaks;</li>
            <li>new equipment or furniture; and</li>
            <li>obstructed access.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Staff must determine the safety of Participants’ homes at each visit
            and before commencing their duties. This includes undertaking a
            visual scan of the home immediately on arrival, and of any equipment
            to be used, before use. Where possible, hazards should be
            fixed/rectified before services start. Staff must report any
            identified High Risks to Wagtail Services’ Directors immediately for
            review and action before commencing services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants, families, carers and others in the home are
            responsible for:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              maintaining a safe work environment for staff (for example,
              repairing broken steps, mowing long grass, restraining animals,
              providing adequate lighting, etc.);
            </li>
            <li>
              looking after their own in-home safety (for example, maintaining
              electrical equipment and installing smoke alarms and safety
              switches to switchboards);
            </li>
            <li>
              cooperating with staff to ensure they can work in a safe way (for
              example, moving furniture to allow adequate work space, etc.);
            </li>
            <li>
              keeping their equipment safe, well maintained and in good order;
              and
            </li>
            <li>informing staff of any known hazards.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where Participants do not have facilities for managing extreme
            temperatures in their home (e.g. heaters or fans/air conditioners),
            staff should dress appropriately to meet the expected weather
            temperatures. Refer to Wagtail Services’ Work Health and Safety
            Policy and Procedure for further guidance.
          </p>

          <h3>Working in a Shared Living Environment</h3>
          <p>
            All staff working in Supported Independent Living services will
            receive instruction in how to manage the risks associated with
            delivering services in a shared living environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Leadership Team will conduct risk assessments and management
            plans for Supported Independent Living services, and amend policies
            and procedures where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Leadership Team will review risks and incidents on a monthly
            basis, and refer any issues identified for inclusion in the
            Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>

          <h3>In the Event of an Emergency or a Fire Drill</h3>
          <p>
            All staff and visitors must follow instructions given by Wagtail
            Services’ nominated fire warden during security and fire drills or
            an emergency situation. Refer to Wagtail Services’ Emergency
            Planning Policy and Procedure for more information.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event of a drill or emergency, staff must ensure that all
            visitors are escorted to the evacuation point, provided it is safe
            to do so.
          </p>

          <h3>Theft or Damage to Property or Premises</h3>
          <p>
            In the event that any personal property is lost or stolen, staff and
            visitors should inform the Manager, who will take further action
            such as contacting the Police.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event that any Wagtail Services property is lost or stolen,
            staff must inform the Manager, who will take further action, such as
            contacting the Police and relevant insurance company.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Maintenance and Management of Premises, Equipment, Furniture and
            Lighting
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Manager will formally inspect Wagtail Services’ premises on a
            six-monthly basis using the Workplace Inspection Checklist, in
            accordance with the Internal Review and External Audit Schedule. The
            checklist covers items such as:
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will take necessary corrective action to ensure any
            unacceptable condition or identified hazard is resolved. If a
            maintenance issue is identified and it poses an immediate threat,
            the staff member must notify the Leadership Team immediately, and
            where possible, isolate the risk.
          </p>

          <h3>Equipment Hazards</h3>
          <p>
            All staff are required to care for Wagtail Services equipment in an
            appropriate manner and to ensure that it is clean and safe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Broken equipment or furniture, lighting or ventilation should be
            reported to the Manager immediately and removed where possible.
            Hazardous equipment will be stored in appropriate places to prevent
            injury.
          </p>

          <p>
            Repairs that do not present an immediate risk to staff, Participants
            or other stakeholders will be assessed by the Manager and passed on
            to the appropriate person to repair the problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            For identified risks that relate to electrical equipment or
            electrical safety, refer to Wagtail Services’ Workplace Health and
            Safety Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Participant Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            Participants may have their own equipment that Wagtail Services
            staff are also required to use, or that is used whilst Wagtail
            Services staff are delivering services. In order to ensure the
            safety of both Participants and staff, prior to using any
            Participant equipment, staff are to inspect the equipment, looking
            for signs of wear and tear, or any other issues that may impact on
            its use.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants are responsible for maintaining their own equipment as
            per manufacturer’s guidelines, unless otherwise negotiated with
            Wagtail Services. In either case, the schedule of equipment
            maintenance must be documented on the Participant’s Support Plan
            summary.
          </p>

          <h3>Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            Incidents relating to safety, security or maintenance of the
            premises should be reported in accordance with Wagtail Services’
            Incident Management policies and procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            If noise causes discomfort, staff, Participants and other
            stakeholders should report the problem to the Manager and options to
            reduce noise/provide PPE may be considered.
          </p>
