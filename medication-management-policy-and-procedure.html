        <div class="content">
          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

          <p>
            The purpose of this policy is to ensure Wagtail Services promotes
            duty of care principles that require staff to maintain a high level
            of competency when reminding Participants about, supervising the
            intake of or administering medication.
          </p>

          <p>
            Medication management practices place Participants at the centre of
            planning and delivery and maximises, as much as possible, the
            capacity for Participants to take control of their service
            provision.
          </p>

          <p>
            It applies to all staff and meets relevant legislation, regulations
            and Standards as set out in Schedule 1, Legislative References.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Standards</h2>

          <h3>Management of Medication</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant requiring medication is confident their provider
            administers, stores and monitors the effects of their medication and
            works to prevent errors or incidents.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Records clearly identify the medication and dosage required by
              each Participant, including all information required to correctly
              identify the Participant and to safely administer the medication.
            </li>
            <li>
              All workers responsible for administering medication understand
              the effects and side-effects of the medication and the steps to
              take in the event of an incident involving medication.
            </li>
            <li>
              All medications are stored safely and securely, can be easily
              identified and differentiated, and are only accessed by
              appropriately trained workers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Definitions</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Dose Administration Aids</strong> – pharmacy prepared aids
            whereby solid oral medications are divided, sealed and packaged
            according to the dose schedule throughout the day. Dose
            administration aids are fully labelled by a pharmacist and used
            where persons may have specific problems preventing them from
            managing their medications in the original manufacturers packaging.
            Dose administration aids can be blister packs, sachet systems and
            compartmentalised boxes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Medication Administration</strong> - If a person is unable
            to independently manage their medication, staff may need to ensure
            that the person gets offered or is given their medication.
            Administration of medicines is one, all, or a combination of the
            staff member doing the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              deciding which medicine(s) have to be taken or applied and when
              this should be done;
            </li>
            <li>being responsible for selecting the medicines;</li>
            <li>
              giving a person medicine to swallow, apply or inhale, where the
              person receiving them does not have the capacity to know what the
              medicine is for or identify it; and
            </li>
            <li>
              giving medicines where the staff member must possess the
              appropriate training and qualifications to do so, including
              regular ongoing competency assessments.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Medication Assistance </strong>– as with prompting, the
            person is assessed as being able to self-medicate, and is in control
            of their medicines but needs assistance with simple mechanical
            tasks, these can include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              ordering repeat prescriptions from the General Practitioner’s
              surgery;
            </li>
            <li>picking up prescriptions;</li>
            <li>collecting dispensed medicines from the pharmacy;</li>
            <li>
              bringing medicines to a person at their request so that they can
              take the medicines;
            </li>
            <li>
              opening bottles or packaging at the request and direction of the
              person who is going to take the medicine;
            </li>
            <li>
              reading labels and checking the time at the request of the person
              who is going to take the medicine; and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring the person has a drink to take with his or her
              medication.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Medication Prompting </strong>- reminding or encouraging a
            person to take their medication. The person is still in control of
            their medicines and may decide not to take them or to take them
            later. Prompting can be useful when a person knows what medicines to
            take and how to take them but may simply forget the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Non-Packaged Medication</strong> – any medication that is
            not in its original packaging as supplied by the pharmacist. This
            type of medication is not to be administered due to the potential
            risks involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Non-Prescription Medicine</strong> – any medication that has
            been purchased or obtained without a formal general
            practitioner/hospital prescription, often referred to as ‘over the
            counter’ medicines. This includes complementary and alternative
            medications, supplements, homeopathic medications and complementary
            medication (deemed illegal).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pro Re Nata (PRN) Medication</strong> – PRN medication is
            prescribed by a health professional for a person to take as needed.
            PRN medication can include prescription and non-prescription
            medications. Persons requiring support to manage PRN medication/s
            must be referred to a Registered Nurse for management.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supporting Self Medication</strong> – supporting a person
            with their self-medication means the person is cognitively aware,
            has been educated about and accepts responsibility for their own
            medication regime. For various reasons however the person is unable
            to take the medication out of the container and/or requires
            assistance with drinking to take the medication.
          </p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            The health and safety of all Wagtail Services staff and Participants
            is of utmost importance, including in the management and
            administration of Participants’ medications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services acknowledges that medication management practices
            build on individual strengths and reflect individual needs,
            interests, goals, formal and information support networks.
          </p>

          <p>
            All medication management practices for each Participant are
            informed by individual Support Plans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will assist Participants to manage their medication
            based on the following order of preference:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              the Participant self-manages all aspects of their medication;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant is supported or assisted by their family or
              support network to manage all aspects of their medication;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant manages their medications with Wagtail Services
              staff providing medication prompting;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant manages their medications with Wagtail Services
              staff providing medication assistance; or
            </li>
            <li>
              Wagtail Services staff managing and administering medication for
              the Participant.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>Consent</h3>

          <p>
            When providing medication management, Wagtail Services staff must
            first ensure the Participant has provided consent via a Medication
            Plan and Consent Form. The Medication Plan and Consent Form provides
            detailed information about the medications, the type of support
            required and consent for Wagtail Services to provide medication
            management.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants must be informed about Wagtail Services’ medication
            management processes in a way that meets their communication needs
            and cognition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants are encouraged and supported to be involved in decision
            making as far as possible according to their capacity, including
            Wagtail Services focussing on supporting and encouraging
            Participants to self-administer their medication as the first step
            where appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the Participant is unable to provide consent, an authorised
            person responsible for making health related decisions is able to
            provide consent.
          </p>

          <h3>Capacity Determination</h3>

          <p>
            Where Wagtail Services is uncertain about a Participant’s ability to
            safely manage and administer their own medication, a
            capacity/competency assessment must be completed by a qualified
            health care professional (such as a General Practitioner) in
            consultation with the Participant and those involved in their care.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given capacity can vary over time, a reassessment should be
            completed regularly by a qualified health care professional to
            determine if the Participant’s capacity has changed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where appropriate, Participants should be supported to implement
            strategies to work towards improving their capacity to
            self-administer and manage their medications.
          </p>

          <h3>Staff Training and Requirements</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services, as per the Human Resources Policy and Procedure,
            will ensure that the relevant staff have a level of competency to
            provide appropriate and safe support to a person with disability.
            This includes medication management.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must have a process in place to ensure the
            recruitment, training and scheduling of staff are competent in
            medications management.
          </p>

          <p>
            All staff supporting Participants with medication management
            (prompt, assist and administer) must have already completed training
            in First Aid and Assist Clients with Medication.
          </p>

          <p>
            An employee may also be assessed as competent if they have a higher
            qualification, for example a Registered Nurse who is acting within
            the scope of their employment.
          </p>

          <p>
            If staff are required to undertake more complex medication
            administration to support an individual’s complex health Support
            Plan, additional training relating to more complex medication
            administration must be arranged, and a suitably trained staff member
            will assist the Participant until such a time this can occur.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must participate in a review of their medication management
            knowledge and performance at least every 12 months by a suitability
            qualified staff member, such as a registered nurse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will ensure all staff involved in management of
            Participants’ medications complete refresher training at least every
            3 years, including coverage of recent changes in medication
            management practices and review of competencies.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to an annual review of knowledge and performance,
            Wagtail Services may provide refresher training to staff should the
            following occur:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              an incident or error occurs that is linked to medication
              management competencies;
            </li>
            <li>a request is made by the Manager;</li>
            <li>
              a request is made by a member of the Leadership Team where there
              are performance issues relating to specific medication management
              tasks;
            </li>
            <li>
              there is a change in a Participant’s health or medication needs
              requiring a different range of competencies; or

          <h3>
            Participants Self-administering and Managing their Own Medications
          </h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will support and encourage Participants to manage
            and administer their own medication where appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where required, the Manager will request written advice from a
            Participant’s medical practitioner or authorised representative,
            notifying that a Participant has appropriate training and skill to
            assume responsibility for the management of their own medication.
          </p>

          <h3>Participants Unable to Self-administer their Own Medications</h3>

          <p>
            Staff members are to provide the Participant with the agreed upon
            assistance (prompt, assist or administer) as per the signed
            Medication Plan and Consent Form and in line with the Participant’s
            Support Plan.
          </p>

          <h3><u>Types of Management</u></h3>

          <h3>1. Prompting Medication</h3>

          <p>
            Given Participants still remain in control of their medicines, this
            type of management is where staff simply remind the Participant of
            the need to take their medications.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Participant’s Support Plan must clearly stipulate the time of
            day for the staff member to prompt the Participant, regardless of
            whether the Participant chooses not to take them or take them later.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff remind the Participant the time of day and ask them if they
            have taken their medication. This may occur as a stand-alone service
            or part of other services provided.
          </p>

          <p>Prompting does not include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>pouring out liquid medication;</li>
            <li>popping tablets out of containers;</li>
            <li>physically handling tablets or medicines;</li>
            <li>selecting the medicine for the Participant;</li>
            <li>advising which medicine to take; or</li>
            <li>explaining dosage, applying creams or giving injections.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff are required to complete the Medication Management Checklist
            for each prompting service to demonstrate correct processes have
            been followed.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Assisting with Medication</h3>

          <p>
            Staff are to assist Participants who are able to retain control of
            their medication management however need assistance with the
            mechanical tasks associated.
          </p>

          <p>Assisting with medicines can include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>

              and hand the container to the Participant as requested;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide assistance with opening a medication container as
              requested by the Participant;
            </li>
            <li>
              remove medication from a container and place it into another
              container (such as a Pil-Bob) or the Participant’s hand as
              requested;
            </li>
            <li>
              observe the Participant to ensure they do not experience
              difficulty in administering their medication;
            </li>
            <li>
              assist the Participant to make a record of the medication taken.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff are required to complete the Medication Management Checklist
            for each assistance service to demonstrate correct processes have
            been followed.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Administration of Medication</h3>

          <p>
            If Participants have been assessed as unable to administer or manage
            their medication, the Support Plan and Medication Plan and Consent
            Form must contain clear instructions about the physical assistance
            and supervisory role the staff will take in the administration of
            medications.
          </p>

          <p>
            The level of support a Participant requires varies and will
            regularly need to be reviewed throughout their time receiving care.
          </p>

          <p>
            All medication to be administered by staff must be prescribed by the
            Participant’s health practitioner and within its original packaging
            or a Dose Administration Aid.
          </p>

          <p>
            An up-to-date pharmacy/health practitioner’s list of the
            Participant’s current medications must be kept with the medications
            to be administered. This list must be updated with each medication

          <p>
            Staff are to follow their accredited training in medication
            management in relation to the rules for safe administration of
            medication.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to administering medication, staff must prepare the
            Participant by communicating and discussing the procedure,
            encouraging participation where possible. Staff must also establish
            the Participant’s preference relating to medication administration,
            complete all personal hygiene steps and prepare all resources
            required.
          </p>

          <p>Staff administering medication must ensure:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>the right medication is being administered;</li>
            <li>the medication is being administered to the right person;</li>
            <li>the right dose is being administered;</li>

            <li>the right documentation is being completed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff administering medication must also ensure the Participant’s
            right to refuse their medication, ensuring to document this clearly
            within a Medication Incident Report Form.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff administering medication should as far as possible understand:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>the reason the Participant is taking each medication;</li>
            <li>how the medication is to be stored and administered;</li>
            <li>

              a seizure or other immediate health concern; or
            </li>
            <li>
              the staff member identifies a medication administration error from
              the previous administration service (i.e. missed medication from
              previous staff member visiting).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>

          </ul>

          <h3>Alterations to Medication</h3>

          <p>
            Some medications may have a reduction in effectiveness or a greater

          </p>

          <h3>Medication Management Documentation</h3>

          <p>
            A Medication Management Checklist is to be maintained for each
            Participant who receives support with medication management from
            Wagtail Services.

              adverse drug reactions;
            </li>
            <li>
              detail the type of management required (prompt, assist,
              administer);

              provide space for the staff member to list and sign their name as
              the person responsible for that medication support delivered.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Storing Medications</h3>

          <p>
            Participants managing their medication (including SIL Participants)
            are to be encouraged / supported to store their medicines as per the
            manufacturer’s instructions, to maintains the quality of the
            medicine. Storage should also safeguard the Participant, their

            refrigeration should be stored in the fridge (not in the fridge
            door) to maintain optimum temperature. Medication should be kept in
            original containers or pharmacy issued dose administration aids,
            away from children and vulnerable people, and separately from food
            and/or other chemicals.

            support need to be aware of the Participant’s current medication
            management plan and be adequately qualified to provide the
            prompt/assist/administration. See Wagtail Services’ Assessment,
            Planning and Review Policy and Procedure and Human Resources Policy
