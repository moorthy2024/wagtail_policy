          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services may generate waste that is unsafe to dispose of
            with general waste, as part of its delivery of NDIS supports.
            Appropriate waste disposal is important for infection control.
            Different types of waste have different waste management procedures
            that need to be followed.
          </p>

          <p>
            When specific waste is appropriately handled and contained through
            safe work practices and the use of appropriate personal protective
            equipment (PPE), the risk of exposure to infection, chemical
            contamination, radiation exposure or other health and safety issues
            is minimised.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Emergency Plan includes responding to clinical
            waste or hazardous substance management issues and accidents.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff involved in the management of waste and hazardous substances
            are trained to ensure safe and appropriate handling. This includes
            training on any protective equipment and clothing required when
            handling waste or hazardous substances.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services will develop and implement a Waste Management Plan
            relevant to the types of waste it is likely to generate. The Waste
            Management Plan must be developed in consultation with other
            co-located services such as pathology services, and will cover:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              who has overall responsibility for the plan as well as the

          </p>

          <h3>Minimum Requirements for Waste Disposal</h3>

          <p>
            Disposal of any contaminated or hazardous waste generated by Wagtail
            Services activities must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              be disposed of in accordance with the legislative requirements for
              the type of waste;
            </li>
            <li>
              be conducted and implemented in consultation with relevant staff;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              occur based on a risk management process that is used when
              planning and implementing hazardous waste disposal.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Disposal</h3>

          <p>
            This Policy and Procedure covers disposal of Clinical and
            Pharmaceutical waste, given this is the waste most likely to be
            produced in the delivery of Wagtail Servicesâ€™ NDIS supports.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should general waste be mixed or contaminated with any of the above
            listed waste it must be then treated as the contaminated or
            hazardous waste.
          </p>

          <h3>Clinical Waste</h3>
          <p>
            Clinical waste is generally categorised as an Infectious Substance,
            and staff should minimise the handling of waste bags and avoid
            decanting waste from one bin to another. When clinical waste bags
            must be handled, they should be held away from the body by the
            closed top of the bag and placed directly into a bin appropriate to
            the waste. Gloves, apron and protective eyewear must be worn. If a
            Participant has symptoms of a communicable disease (e.g.
            gastroenteritis), face masks must also be worn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Waste bags must not be filled to more than two-thirds of their
            capacity and contents are to be secured within the bag when closing.
            Before closing the bag, excess air should be excluded without
            compacting the waste in the bag. Waste bags should be taken out to
            the Council bin as soon as possible, or at the end of the shift.
          </p>

          <h3>Pharmaceutical Waste</h3>

          <p><u>Disposal</u></p>

          <p>
            Pharmaceutical waste must be disposed of safely and in a manner that
            is not harmful to the environment. Medication to be destroyed (i.e.
            out of date, no longer required or incorrectly dispensed) must be
            labelled and disposed of in an appropriate bag and returned to the
            local pharmacist for disposal under the Returned Unwanted Medicine
            program.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the Participant, their supporter or family is unable to return
            pharmaceutical waste, Wagtail Servicesâ€™ staff will dispose of it on
            their behalf. Wagtail Services will provide staff with address and

          <p><u>Labelling</u></p>

          <p>
            Pharmaceutical waste packages/containers must be marked with the
            label PHARMACEUTICAL WASTE. No symbols or signage are required.
          </p>

          <h3>Sharps Waste</h3>

          <p>
            Sharps injuries are a common cause of getting infected by a
            blood-borne virus. The following basic requirements should apply if
            sharps are used or found:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>whoever uses the sharp, disposes of it;</li>
            <li>donâ€™t pass sharps by hand, use tongs;</li>
            <li>use disposable sharps;</li>
            <li>
              donâ€™t put a used needle back in its cover, put it in a sharps
              container;
            </li>
            <li>donâ€™t separate a needle from a syringe;</li>
            <li>donâ€™t break, burn or manipulate a sharp;</li>
            <li>
              donâ€™t clean re-usable sharps by hand, use a long-handled brush and
              tongs;
            </li>
            <li>
              donâ€™t put hands or fingers into garbage bags, laundry bags,
              crevices etc. where you suspect there are sharps â€“ use tongs;
            </li>
            <li>
              donâ€™t manually compress garbage bags â€“ use the tie-straps to lift
              and carry the bag; and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure that any containers are kept out of reach of children.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><u>Disposal</u></p>

          <p>
            Sharps must be disposed of in an approved sharps disposable
            container (yellow with biohazard symbol). Sharps containers that are
            resistant to impact, penetration and leakage, are stable, have
            integrity of the handles/other carrying features and closure device,
            and have a capacity indicator (fill line) marked on the outside wall
            of the container must be used. PPE must be worn at all times when
            handling sharps, including gloves and safety glasses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff MUST NOT use drinks cans, bottles or cardboard boxes to
            dispose of sharps â€“ they may find their way into domestic waste and
            present a hazard to council workers and the public.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff should never try to retrieve anything from a sharps container,
            or press down on the contents to make more room. Containers must be
            labelled and regularly emptied.
          </p>

          <p><u>Labelling</u></p>

          <p>
            Sharps disposable containers must bear the Division 6.2 label and be
            marked with the label CLINICAL SHARPS.
          </p>

          <h3>Chemical Waste</h3>

          <p><u>Disposal</u></p>
          <p>
            When disposing of chemicals and containers that have contained
            hazardous chemicals:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              check the label for advice on disposal of chemicals or containers;
            </li>
            <li>
              triple rinse empty containers to remove all traces of the
              chemical; and
            </li>
            <li>uncap, puncture and/or crush all rinsed containers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Ensure that appropriate PPE (e.g. gloves and safety glasses) are
            worn before handling or rinsing the empty containers.
          </p>

          <p><u>Labelling</u></p>
          <p>
            Chemical waste packages/containers must be labelled with the product
            identifier (name) and the relevant hazard pictogram/symbol depending
            on the type of hazard classification (e.g. corrosive, flammable,
            toxic). It must also include the Australian name, address and
            contact details of the manufacturer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Labelling requirements do not apply to household consumer products,
            however, if the original label is faded, worn or illegible, a
            replacement label/sticker must be applied so that the contents can
            be easily identified.
          </p>

          <p>
            See also Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Chemical Use and Storage Policy and
            Procedure for further details.
          </p>

          <h3>Internal Transport and Tracking</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services must optimise the waste collection process, reduce
            handling and transportation, and promote safe work practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            When removing waste, staff should avoid walking through food
            preparation and heavily used areas (e.g. kitchen) taking a direct
            route to the outside bin if possible. This further reduces the risk
            of contamination should an accident occur (e.g. slip/trip/fall).
          </p>

          <h3>Managing Spills</h3>

          <p>Wagtail Services must ensure that:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              its Waste Management Plan sets out procedures for waste spills;
            </li>
            <li>
              staff involved in spill management are trained in emergency
              procedures and handling requirements, including use of spill kits;
            </li>
            <li>
              spill kits are readily accessible and clearly labelled and mapped;
            </li>
            <li>
              it stocks PPE and emergency spill kits appropriate to the waste
              handled;
            </li>
            <li>spill kits are disposed of with the relevant waste; and</li>
            <li>
              spill kits are restocked with the necessary components immediately
              after use, returned to their locations and regularly inspected for
              malfunctioning or missing components.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Personal Protective Equipment</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will supply the necessary Personal Protective
            Equipment (PPE) for the types of waste that may be handled. Staff
            must use appropriate PPE when handling waste, including gloves,
            safety eyewear and in some cases, an apron.
          </p>

          <h3>Reporting</h3>

          <p>
            Incidents relating to waste management and disposal should be
            reported in accordance with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Incident Management
            Policies and Procedures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Workers who sustain a needlestick injury or are exposed to blood
            and/or body fluids may need to be notified to the Regulator â€“ refer
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Workplace Incident Reporting Policy and Procedure
            for further guidance.
