            Grievances Policy and Procedure, however from time to time staff may
            raise issues or provide feedback that is best dealt with under this
            policy and procedure.
          </p>

          <p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <h3>General</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Leadership Team must promote best practice,
            continuous improvement and an open, respectful culture that
            encourages and supports staff, Participants and other stakeholders
            to make complaints without fear of retribution. This is assessed in
            yearly Performance Reviews of Leadership Team staff.
          </p>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Human Resources Policy and Procedure, all
            staff must undergo initial training and orientation, which includes
            training in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ feedback and complaints processes.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            Agendas for team meetings include a standing item on Continuous
            Improvement, including a review of feedback and complaints.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services uses its Participant Charter, Participant Handbook,
            and a Feedback and Complaints Form to provide Participants,
            families, carers and all other stakeholders with information about
            this policy and procedure, in an easy to understand format.
            Information provided includes how to make a complaint to Wagtail
            Services and to the NDIS Commissioner and other external bodies, how
            complaints will be addressed and external advocacy and support
            services that can assist people in the complaints process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must provide Participants and their supporters with
            information about Wagtail Servicesâ€™ feedback and complaints
            processes when they first access the service. Throughout service
            delivery, staff must remind Participants and their supporters of
            their right to make a complaint without fear of affecting their
            service. Any person wishing to lodge feedback or a complaint must
            also be provided with this information.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants understand their right to make a complaint
            and how to make a complaint, staff must provide information to them
            and their supporters in ways that suit their individual
            communication needs. Written information can be provided in Easy
            English or explained verbally by staff. Staff can also help
            Participants access interpreters or advocates where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager must track and review feedback and complaints to
            identify ongoing issues using Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Complaints Register
            and report feedback and complaints data to the Leadership Team at
            its monthly meetings.
          </p>

          <h3>Privacy and Information Management</h3>

          <p>
            All personal information Wagtail Services collects to manage
            feedback or complaints must be handled in accordance with Wagtail
            Servicesâ€™ Privacy and Confidentiality Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must keep information about complaints confidential. They may
            only disclose necessary detail if they are required to do so by law,
            or if not disclosing is likely to place the safety, health or
            wellbeing of any person at risk. Staff must take all reasonable
            steps to notify the complainant before deciding not to keep personal
            information confidential.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Complaints Register must be used to record
            information about feedback and complaints; any action taken to
            resolve complaints and the outcome of any action taken. All
            information regarding feedback and complaints is kept securely in
            accordance with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Records and Information Management
            Policy and Procedure. All records regarding complaints must be
            retained for at least 7 years from the date they are created.
          </p>

          <h3>Feedback</h3>

          <p>
            Where feedback is provided verbally, the receiving staff member will
            transcribe it onto a Wagtail Services Feedback and Complaints Form.
          </p>

          <h3>Complaints</h3>
          <p>
            People can make a complaint about any aspects of Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            services, including breaches of policies and procedures or the Code
            of Conduct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ complaints management process can be simplified
            into five steps:
          </p>

          <h4>1. Complaint Lodgement</h4>

          <p>
            To lodge a complaint, people are encouraged to speak directly to a
            staff member first, in an attempt to resolve the matter without
            recourse to Wagtail Servicesâ€™ complaints procedures.
          </p>
          <p>Staff must:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              listen openly to the concerns being raised by the complainant;
            </li>
            <li>ask the complainant what outcome they are seeking;</li>
            <li>
              inform the complainant of the complaint process and how to
              formally make a complaint to Wagtail Services, the NDIS
              Commissioner or other complaints body and the time the process
              takes;
            </li>
            <li>
              be empathic towards the person and action all commitments made;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              action situations that pose an immediate threat or danger or
              require a specialised response.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the complaint is resolved, it must be reported to the Manager for
            inclusion in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Feedback and Complaints Register.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the complaint cannot be resolved promptly or within 24 hours, it
            must be referred to the Manager. The Manager will advise the person
            of their right to lodge a formal complaint if they have not already
            done so, with the assistance of a support person or advocate if they
            wish. A Feedback and Complaints Form will be made available to the
            individual to lodge their complaint, however it is not mandatory
            that they use the form. Formal complaints can be lodged:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              directly with a staff member, either verbally or by providing a
              completed Feedback and Complaints Form;
            </li>
            <li>by email to: anthony@wagtailservices.com.au; or</li>
            <li>by phone on 0416 679 142</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Complaints and feedback can be lodged by a third party on behalf of
            another person, if their consent or the consent of their legal
            representative has been provided.
          </p>

          <p>
            At any time, people can make a complaint about NDIS service
            providers or the support they provide to the NDIS Commission or
            other external complaints bodies (listed below).
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must assist people making a complaint, or people with
            disability affected by a complaint, to contact the NDIS Commission
            or other complaints body, where this is required.
          </p>

          <p>
            People making or impacted by a complaint must be encouraged to use
            an advocate of their choice to act on their behalf if they wish. The
            advocate may be a family member or friend, or sourced (with
            assistance from staff if required) through the National Disability
            Advocacy Program.

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>by phone on 1800 800 110; and</li>

          </p>

          <ul>

            <li>online at www.ombudsman.gov.au.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff must support people making a complaint about the NDIA to
            contact the Agency or Commonwealth Ombudsman, where this is
            required.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Record</h4>

          <p>
            The Manager must record all information relevant to complaints, in
            its original and simplest form, in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Complaints
            Register. The Complaints Register must be stored in a secure file,
            accessible only to the Leadership Team.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Acknowledge</h4>

          <p>
            The Manager must acknowledge receipt of complaints within 2 working
            days. However, where a person has requested to remain anonymous,
            contact may not be possible or expected.
          </p>

          <p>
            In their acknowledgement, the Manager must set realistic
            expectations regarding complaint resolution and refer the matter to
            other organisations where they are identified as being more suitable
            to handle it. Acknowledgements must provide timeframes for
            resolution where possible.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Resolve</h4>

          <p>
            Investigation of complaints will not be conducted by a person about
            whom a complaint has been made, or a person who has a conflict of
            interest in the matter. If required, the Leadership Team will
            determine the appropriate person to undertake the investigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            In resolving a complaint, the Manager must involve the complainant
            and keep them informed of the progress of the complaint. They must
            discuss any disparities identified with the complainant and may
            request additional information when required. A timeframe within
            which further information is to be provided should be clearly
            communicated with the complainant.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager should consider granting extensions where necessary and
            always communicate any additional time requirements to the
            complainant with an explanation of the need.
          </p>

          <p>
            Complaint investigation must focus on the identified complaint
            matters only. All parties involved in a complaint must be provided
            with procedural fairness and with the support and information
            necessary to participate in the complaints process.
          </p>

          <p>
            All decisions or actions regarding complaint investigation must be
            recorded by the Manager in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Complaints Register.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Communicate Resolution</h4>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will respond to all complaints as soon as possible
            and within 28 days from acknowledgement.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a complaint cannot be responded to in full within 28 days of
            acknowledgement, an update must be issued to the complainant. The
            update must provide the date by which a full response can be
            expected. The update should be provided verbally in the first
            instance then confirmed in writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager should discuss the outcome of a complaint investigation
            verbally with the complainant, where possible. This must be followed
            by written advice that provides the complainant an opportunity to
            make further contact with the Manager if required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The written advice must also include information on what further
            action may be available to the complainant at the conclusion of the
            complaint investigation. This may include escalating the matter
            further with an external agency or seeking a further review within
            the business. Written advice should also seek feedback from the
            complainant regarding their experience of the complaints process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Support must be provided to assist complainantsâ€™ understanding of
            correspondence regarding complaints, where this is required (e.g.
            interpreters, referral to advocates, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
            Options for responding to a complaint may include, but are not
            limited to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>explaining processes;</li>
            <li>rectifying an issue;</li>
            <li>providing an apology;</li>
            <li>ongoing monitoring; and</li>
            <li>training or educating staff.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Once resolved, complaint outcomes must be relayed to the appropriate
            area within Wagtail Services in order to improve service delivery.
          </p>

          <h3>Feedback and Complaint Review</h3>

          <p>
            Feedback and complaint review includes identifying, monitoring and
            acting upon trends and systemic issues identified through the
            analysis of feedback and complaint information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The purpose of analysing feedback and complaint data is to learn
            from patterns in order to safeguard the safety and wellbeing of
            individual Participants, as well as improve the quality of supports.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Complaints Register must be reviewed at quarterly Leadership
            Team meetings. The Manager is responsible for monitoring the
            Complaints Register in order to analyse and report on trends.
          </p>

          <p>Reviews should consider:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the causes, handling and outcomes of feedback and complaints;
            </li>
            <li>
              processes, timeframes and record keeping practices associated with
              feedback and complaint management; and
            </li>
            <li>
              feedback provided by staff and Participants about Wagtail
              Servicesâ€™ feedback and complaint management.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where preventative or improvement measures are identified, these
            must be tracked in the Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>

            </li>
            <li>any barriers to lodging complaints and feedback.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Continuous Improvement Register will be used to
            record improvements identified and monitor the progress of their
            implementation. Where relevant, this information will be considered
            as part of Wagtail Servicesâ€™ service planning and delivery
            processes.
