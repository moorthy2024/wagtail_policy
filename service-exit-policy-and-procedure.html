        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

          <p>
            This policy and procedure sets out Wagtail Services’ transparent and
            equitable service exit procedures, which are designed to uphold the
            rights of people with disability and support them to transition to
            other supports where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            It applies to all potential and existing Participants, their family
            members, carers and other supporters and meets relevant legislation,
            regulations and Standards as set out in Schedule 1, Legislative
            References.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Transitions to or From the Provider</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant experiences a planned and coordinated transition to
            or from the provider.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A planned transition to or from the provider is facilitated in
              collaboration with each Participant when possible, and this is
              documented, communicated and effectively managed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Risks associated with each transition to or from the provider are
              identified, documented and responded to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Processes for transitioning to or from the provider are developed,
              applied, reviewed and communicated.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Participants have the right to terminate their service provision and
            any time, and this decision will not prejudice future access to the
            service. Exit procedures are fair, transparent, follow due process,
            uphold the rights of Participants and protect the safety and
            integrity of Wagtail Services staff, Participants, programs and
            services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participant transitions from Wagtail Services’ services are planned
            and coordinated and undertaken in collaboration with Participants.
            Transition arrangements are documented, communicated and effectively
            managed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where Participants are transferring to other services, the
            transition is collaboratively planned, and the process is
            documented, communicated and effectively managed.
          </p>

          <h3>Procedures</h3>

          <p>
            Should a Participant, their supporter/s or Wagtail Services wish to
            end service provision before the dates set out in the Service
            Agreement, they must give the other party at least 2 weeks’ notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Service exit and referral information must be tracked in Nightingale
            to inform continuous improvement.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager is responsible for ensuring staff are familiar with the
            requirements of this policy and have sufficient skills, knowledge
            and ability to meet the requirements. As per Wagtail Services’ Human
            Resources Policy and Procedure, all staff must undergo initial
            training and orientation, which includes training in Wagtail
            Services’ exit processes. Staff knowledge and application of this
            policy and procedure is monitored on a day-to-day basis and through
            annual Performance Reviews. Additional formal and on-the-job
            training is provided to staff where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participant feedback and complaints regarding this policy and
            procedure must be addressed in accordance with Wagtail Services’
            Feedback and Complaints Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            In accordance with Wagtail Services’ Privacy and Confidentiality
            Policy and Procedure, respect for and protection of Participants’
            privacy and confidentiality must be reinforced with Participants on
            an ongoing basis, verbally and in other information provided by
            staff.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where required, Participants must be provided with information and
            support to access a person of their choice, such as an advocate, to
            assist them to transition from Wagtail Services. See the Decision
            Making and Choice Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants or their representatives understand how to
            transition from Wagtail Services’ services, Wagtail Services uses
            its Participant Charter, Participant Handbook to provide information
            about this policy and procedure, in an easy to understand format.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants understand this information, staff must
            provide information to them and their supporters in ways that suit
            their individual communication needs. Written information can be
            provided in Easy English or explained verbally by staff. Staff can
            also help Participants access interpreters or advocates where
            required.
          </p>

          <p>
            All Participants exiting the service will be offered an Exit
            Interview, where the Manager will explain the reason for the
            Participant’s service termination (if applicable), obtain feedback
            about where Wagtail Services can improve its processes and
            communicate the steps to re-accessing the service should the
            Participant wish to.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Termination</h3>

          <p>
            As part of Wagtail Services’ entry processes, Participants must be
            informed of their rights and responsibilities. Where a Participant
            is asked to leave Wagtail Services, information regarding the reason
            for being asked to leave must be provided and explained to them.
            These reasons must also be included in the Participant’s Exit Plan
            if required (see below).
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will only terminate a Participant’s services when:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              they are unwilling over a period of time to work towards agreed
              goals;
            </li>
            <li>
              other people using the service, staff or the person themselves are
              at risk of harm;
            </li>
            <li>financial requirements are not being met;</li>
            <li>
              severe incompatibility with other Participants using the service
              is displayed; or
            </li>
            <li>
              dramatic health or behaviour changes require significantly
              increased levels of care or a service model not provided by
              Wagtail Services.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The service exit must only be actioned after discussion and
            consultation with the Participant, their supporter/s and other
            important stakeholders, and strategies have been implemented to meet
            irreconcilable differences. Participants must be offered support to
            access interpreters or advocates to assist them through this process
            if necessary.
          </p>

          <h3>Participant Requested Termination</h3>

          <p>
            Participants have the right to terminate their service provision and
            any time, and this decision will not prejudice their future access
            to the service.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon termination, the Participant will be sent a letter informing
            them of their rights to future service provision and information
            regarding advocacy services if required.
          </p>

          <h3>Appeal</h3>

          <p>
            Participants who have their services terminated by Wagtail Services
            have the right to appeal. Appeals should be directed in writing to
            the Manager and a final decision will be made by the Leadership
            Team. People who successfully appeal will be supported to continue
            accessing Wagtail Services’ services. People who are not successful
            in their appeal will be provided advice in writing to this effect.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a person is unhappy with the outcome of their appeal, they will
            be directed to Wagtail Services’ feedback and complaints processes.
            As per Wagtail Services’ Feedback and Complaints Policy and
            Procedure, information on Wagtail Services’ complaints process can
            be provided in a variety of formats if required as well as support
            to access interpreters or advocates if necessary.
          </p>

          <h3>Exit Transition Planning</h3>

          <p>
            Where relevant, the Manager must work collaboratively with
            Participants and their representatives to identify alternative
            services and referrals that could best meet their needs. See Wagtail
            Services’ Providing Information, Advice and Referrals Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the Participant's or their supporter’s consent, Wagtail
            Services must provide relevant information to new service providers
            to support the Participant's seamless transition to them. Where
            required, Wagtail Services staff should introduce the Participant to
            or meet with staff of alternative providers to facilitate a smooth
            transition for the Participant. See the Information Sharing
            Provisions in Wagtail Services’ Providing Information, Advice and
            Referrals Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to exiting, Participants must be provided guidance and support
            to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              investigate other options or models of support from Wagtail
              Services, if appropriate;
            </li>
            <li>
              explore the consequences of their decision to exit the service (if
              relevant); and
            </li>
            <li>
              consider re-entry to the service in the future should their needs
              or circumstances change.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            An Exit Plan must be agreed with the Participant and with their
            informed consent, any other stakeholders. The Plan must contain
            identified timeframes outlining actions and those responsible to
            implement the actions. In addition, risks associated with the
            transition must be identified, documented and responded to.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must also ensure a copy of the Participant’s most
            recent Participant Risk Assessment and Home Risk Assessment (if
            applicable) are provided to new service providers, with the
            Participant’s consent of this information sharing documented in
            their Exit Plan. In addition, a risk assessment must be completed
            with any new service providers to ensure any risks of the transition
            process are captured within the Exit Plan, along with actions that
            will be taken to reduce those risks.
          </p>

          <p>
            A copy of the Exit Plan must be provided to the Participant. A copy
            must also be kept on the Participant’s file and key elements
            captured in Nightingale. Where this is not practicable, or the
            Participant chooses not to have an Exit Plan, staff must include a
            case note on the Participant’s file explaining the reasons why the
            Participant did not receive a copy of their plan.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Re-entry</h3>

          <p>
            People who have chosen to exit Wagtail Services have the right to
            re-access services within a 1 month period of exiting, without
            having to follow formal access processes, provided the necessary
            service resources are available. After this period, a new intake
            assessment must be undertaken if they wish to re-enter the service.
          </p>

          <h3>Files and Documentation</h3>

          <p>
            Upon a Participant’s exit from Wagtail Services all documentation
            and information developed and implemented by Wagtail Services
            remains the property of the service. Any documentation provided by
            other service providers and included in the Participant’s file that
            has been used to facilitate the Participant’s support must be
            returned to the Participant or their representative or family.
            Wagtail Services will retain copies of these documents.
          </p>

          <p>
            All information in relation to the Participant will be retained,
            secured and stored in accordance with Wagtail Services’ Records and
            Information Management Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

            Leadership Team. Reviews will incorporate staff, Participant and
            other stakeholder feedback. Participants and service networks will
            be advised of any changes.

            Participant satisfaction surveys and service delivery planning
            activities, will assess:
          </p>

          <ul>

            <li>

              and management of appeals regarding exit; and
            </li>
            <li>
              feedback provided by and to Participants and potential
              Participants around access and refusal and whether the information
              provided to Participants is appropriate and effective.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>

            record improvements identified and monitor the progress of their
            implementation. Where relevant, this information will be considered
            as part of Wagtail Services’ service planning and delivery
