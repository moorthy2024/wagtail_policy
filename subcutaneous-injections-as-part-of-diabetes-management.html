          <h2>Background and Definitions</h2>

          <h3>General Medical Information:</h3>

          <p>
            Subcutaneous injections are a fundamental aspect of diabetes care,
            primarily for the administration of insulin, a hormone crucial for
            regulating blood glucose levels. This method involves injecting
            medication into the subcutaneous tissue beneath the skin, allowing
            for steady absorption into the bloodstream. Proper technique and
            consistent management are vital for maintaining blood glucose
            control and preventing diabetes-related complications. Understanding
            the types of insulin, injection techniques, and monitoring of blood
            glucose levels is essential for effective diabetes management.
