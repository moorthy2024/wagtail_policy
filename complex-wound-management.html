          <h2>Background and Definitions</h2>

          <h3>General Medical Information:</h3>

          <p>
            Complex wound management involves the care of wounds that are
            difficult to heal due to underlying conditions such as diabetes,
            vascular diseases, or immobility. This includes chronic wounds like
            pressure ulcers, venous or arterial ulcers, and diabetic foot
            ulcers, as well as wounds resulting from surgical procedures or
            trauma. Effective management requires a holistic approach,
            incorporating assessment, cleansing, dressing, infection control,
            and often, collaboration with specialists. It also involves
            addressing underlying causes, optimizing nutrition, and managing
            pain.
          </p>
