          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this policy and procedure is to provide guidelines
            for reporting, investigating and applying appropriate control
            measures when an accident, incident or near miss occurs that
            involves Wagtail Servicesâ€™ workers. The aim is to ensure that
            incident response is timely and the investigation is thorough so
            that it prevents the incident happening again.
          </p>

          <p>
            This policy and procedure also sets out the steps that staff and
            Wagtail Services must follow when a staff member is injured during
            the course of employment, to support their return to normal duties.
          </p>

          <p>
            It applies to all staff and meets relevant legislation, regulations
            and Standards as set out in Schedule 1, Legislative References.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identifying and reporting child safety concerns, abuse or neglect of

            responding to incidents. Those responsible for investigating any
            accident, incident or near miss as part of their role will also be
            trained in those areas.
          </p>

          <h3>Responding to Incidents</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Assess the situation and check for danger</li>
            <li>Remove the person/s from danger, if it is safe to do so</li>
            <li>Call Emergency Services (dial 000) if required</li>
            <li>
              Attend to the immediate needs of the person/s involved. Apply
              First Aid Treatment if required (and you are trained).
            </li>
            <li>
              Check and ensure there are no others at risk of harm. Do not alter
              the scene (except to make it safe).
            </li>
            <li>
              Notify Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Emergency Contacts as soon as practicable
              should the person/s need medical assistance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wagtail Services will arrange appropriate medical treatment
              depending on the severity of the injury. If an emergency has
              occurred or the injury is severe, the person's Next of Kin will
              also be notified.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Reporting Incidents</h3>

          <p>
            All incidents and near misses must be reported to the Manager as
            soon as practicable and within 24 hours, through completion of a
            Wagtail Services Incident Report.
          </p>

          <p>
            If an incident is considered serious, dangerous or has resulted in a
            death of a staff member, the Director/Manager must report it to
            SafeWork NSW immediately on 13 10 50.
          </p>

          <p>
            So far as reasonably practicable, the site where the incident
            occurred must not be disturbed until either SafeWork NSW or the
            Directors advises that the area is no longer required to be
            preserved.
          </p>

          <p>
            All incidents must be recorded in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Incident
            Register. If a staff member is injured in the incident, the register
            should be completed by them, or by someone on their behalf. The
            register must record the:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>name of the injured staff member;</li>
            <li>
              staff memberâ€™s occupation or job title at the time of injury;
            </li>
            <li>time and date of the injury;</li>
            <li>staff memberâ€™s exact location at the time of the injury;</li>
            <li>nature and cause of the injury;</li>
            <li>names of witnesses, if any, to the injury;</li>
            <li>treatment given;</li>
            <li>date on which the entry in the register is made; and</li>
            <li>the name of the person making the entry.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where an injury could mean the staff member will need to claim
            workers compensation, the Director/Manager must notify Wagtail
            Servicesâ€™ insurer within 48 hours of becoming aware of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Director/Manager may also need to inform the New South Wales
            Police Service and/or other relevant authorities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Director/Manager must track progress and outcomes of accidents,
            incidents and near misses in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Incident Register and
            refer any relevant items for inclusion in Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>

          <p>
            Accidents, incidents and near misses are to be reported to the
            Leadership Team monthly by the Manager as part of their WHS
            reporting. Incidents will be reviewed by the Leadership Team in
            order to determine if there are any trends or preventive measures
            that Wagtail Services can take to prevent future incidents. If
            trends or measures are identified, these will be tracked in Wagtail
            Servicesâ€™ Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>

          <h3>Needlestick Injuries</h3>

          <p>
            Needlestick injuries or exposures to blood and/or body fluids (or
            body substances) must be reported and should be managed in
            accordance with the HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C â€“ Management of
            Health Care Workers Potentially Exposed Policy Directive (NSW

            received any of the following types of medical treatment within 48
            hours of an exposure incident involving contact with blood or body
            substances:
          </p>

          <p>
            1. A worker who has been exposed to blood or body substances and
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>has never been vaccinated against hepatitis B; or</li>
            <li>
              is a non-responder to previous hepatitis B vaccination courses;
              and,
            </li>
            <li>

            result of an exposure incident, such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and
            HIV.
          </p>

          <h3>Chemical Incidents</h3>

            the incident.
          </p>

          <p>
            A copy of the relevant SDS must be taken to the treating medical
            practitioner/hospital.
          </p>

          <h3>Investigating and Resolving Incidents</h3>
          <p>
            The Director/Manager will work with SafeWork NSW and/or other
            relevant authorities to investigate the incident.
          </p>
          <p>The Director/Manager or their nominated representative will:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              commence investigations immediately upon receiving a completed
              Incident Report and, where a staff member is injured, involve them
              in the investigation;
            </li>
            <li>
              implement the most effective controls practicable that do not
              introduce other hazards, and monitor and review these (based on
              Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Risk Management Policy and Procedure);
            </li>
            <li>
              consult with staff who are, or are likely to be, directly
              affected; and
            </li>
            <li>
              track all relevant information in Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Incident
              Register.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Incident Register must be updated to include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>a summary of the incident and date the incident occurred;</li>
            <li>any hazards identified;</li>
            <li>corrective action or controls implemented;</li>
            <li>
              outcomes of reviews of corrective actions or controls implemented.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Upon completion of the investigation the Director/Manager must
            finalise the relevant Incident Report and record the outcomes in the
            Incident Register.
          </p>
          <p>
            The completed Incident Report should be kept on the relevant staff
            memberâ€™s file.
          </p>

          <h3>Debrief and Support</h3>
          <p>
            For all people involved in an accident, incident or near miss, if
            required, the Director/Manager must:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              facilitate an informal debrief amongst supervisors, colleagues or
              peers; and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure appropriate support and access to counselling is made
              available.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services should also support staff with work-related
            injuries or illnesses by:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              discouraging blame. Instead, consider how to prevent future
              incidents and how Wagtail Services can help the person to recover;
            </li>
            <li>
              encouraging co-workers to stay in touch with injured or ill staff
              who are away from work;
            </li>
            <li>
              considering whether there are any barriers to a staff memberâ€™s
              recovery and return to work that Wagtail Services can assist with;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring injured or ill staff are aware of their obligations
              regarding Wagtail Servicesâ€™ support for them to return to work.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Workers Compensation</h3>
          <p>
            All work-related injuries or illnesses must be reported in
            accordance with the â€˜Reporting Incidentsâ€™ section of this policy and
            procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            A staff member who has a work-related injury or illness who is away
            from work due to that injury or illness should nominate and be
            assessed by a doctor. The doctor will determine the kind of
            treatment they require, including the frequency and duration of
            treatment. The doctor will also issue a Certificate of Capacity,
            which is required to make a workers compensation claim. The original
            Certificate of Capacity must be provided to Wagtail Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            The staff member should also complete a Workerâ€™s Injury Claim Form,
            available from SafeWork NSW, and submit it to the Manager. The
            Director/Manager must submit the completed Workerâ€™s Injury Claim
            Form, along with the Certificate of Capacity, to Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            workers compensation insurer within 7 days of receiving it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The insurer will write to the staff member and Wagtail Services to
            advise if the claim has been accepted or if further information is
            required. Insurers are required to provide their decision about the
            staff memberâ€™s work capacity and entitlements to the staff member in
            a single notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            If awarded workers compensation, staff can claim medical expenses
            and may receive weekly payments if they need time off work. If they
            need more than 7 days off work, they must participate in an injury
            management plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            For help regarding the claim process, staff should consult Wagtail
            Servicesâ€™ workers compensation insurer or SIRAâ€™s Customer Service
            Centre (phone 13 10 50). Staff seeking advice about their own claim
            should contact Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Return to Work Coordinator or the
            Workers Compensation Independent Review Office (WIRO) (phone 13 94
            76).
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will make every reasonable effort to support its
            staff in any claim for Workers Compensation, including adhering to
            this Policy and Procedure, providing staff with return to work
            information and assisting staff with planning their return to work.
          </p>

          <h3>Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Return to Work Program</h3>
          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Return to Work Program is a summary of the process
            that will be followed to manage staff with work-related injuries or
            illnesses. The program must align with the injury management program
            administered by Wagtail Servicesâ€™ workers compensation insurer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Leadership Team and Return to Work Coordinator are
            responsible for maintaining the program. It must be reviewed at
            least every two years and should be written in plain English.
          </p>
          <p>
            The policies, procedures, roles, responsibilities and communications
            described in the plan must support timely, safe and durable recovery
            at work and align with requirements in the Work Health and Safety
            Act 2011 (NSW) and Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (NSW).
          </p>

          <h3>Recovery</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Return to Work Coordinator will explain the return
            to work process to injured or ill staff members who have been off
            work and support their return to work as soon as possible to
            encourage recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Return to Work Coordinator will work with returning staff
            members and their treating doctor to develop a Recover at Work Plan.
            The plan should adjust the staff memberâ€™s duties to match their
            capacity for work. This may be a gradual process where the person
            returns to modified duties or reduced hours to accommodate their
            injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wagtail Services will provide suitable duties that are consistent
            with medical advice and that are meaningful, productive and
            appropriate for the personâ€™s physical and psychological condition
            depending on their individual circumstances. Suitable duties may be:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>at the same worksite or a different worksite;</li>

            <li>the same job with different hours or modified duties;</li>

            <li>a different job; or</li>
            <li>full time or part time.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Copies of the staff memberâ€™s Recover at Work Plan must be provided
            to Wagtail Servicesâ€™ workers compensation insurer, the staff member,
            their doctor and their supervisor or manager. A copy should also be
            kept by the staff member coordinating Return to Work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Supervisors, managers and co-workers should be informed of the types
            of duties that the staff member can perform, without compromising
            personal and confidential information about the personâ€™s injury. The
            staff member coordinating Return to Work will ensure the person is
            offered the assistance of a workplace rehabilitation provider if it
            becomes evident that they are not likely to resume their pre-injury
            duties or cannot do so without changes to the workplace or work
            practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recover at Work Plans must be monitored weekly and updated as the
            staff memberâ€™s capacity for duties at work increase.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <h3>Reporting</h3>

          <p>
            The Return to Work Coordinator must report to the Manager on a
            fortnightly basis regarding Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Return to Work
            program, staff membersâ€™ workers compensation claims and the status
            of different staff membersâ€™ Recover at Work Plans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services is also required to report any breaches of New
            South Walesâ€™ workers compensation legislation to the Workers
            Compensation Commission (phone 1300 368 040).
          </p>

          <h3>Enquiries and Complaints</h3>

          <p>
            Where staff, on behalf of Wagtail Services have an unresolved
            enquiry or complaint about a workerâ€™s compensation claim, they
            should contact SIRA (phone 13 10 50).
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff who have an unresolved enquiry or complaint with the insurer
            about their own workers compensation claim should contact the
            Workers Compensation Independent Review Office (WIRO) on 13 94 76 or
            email complaints@wiro.nsw.gov.au.
          </p>

          <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>

          <p>
            The Return to Work Coordinator will work with injured or ill staff
            and their representatives (including union representatives) to
            resolve disagreements about their return to work program or suitable
            duties.
          </p>

          <p>
            If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Return to Work Coordinator
            can request involvement of other parties such as Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            workers compensation insurer, the staff memberâ€™s treating doctor, an
            approved workplace rehabilitation provider or an injury management
            consultant. The Return to Work Coordinator or injured staff member
            may also raise their complaint with SIRA on 13 10 50 or email
            contact@sira.nsw.gov.au
          </p>

          <p>
            If a complaint or dispute relates to the insurerâ€™s decision
            regarding a staff memberâ€™s work capacity or entitlements, the
            insurer may decide to undertake an internal review of its decision.
            An internal review is mandatory if it is requested by the
            complainant. At any point, Wagtail Services or staff may escalate
            their dispute to the Workers Compensation Commission on 1300 368 040
            or email registry@wcc.nsw.gov.au.
