            in accordance with Wagtail Services’ Workplace Incident Management
            Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services has additional obligations if an incident is the
            subject of a complaint (see the Feedback and Complaints Policy and

            ensure all Participants (including children) are safe and takes
            proactive steps to protect them from harm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ incident management system identifies, assesses,
            manages and resolves incidents that occur in connection with

            Wagtail Services will provide support and assistance to people with
            disability affected by an incident (including information about
            access to advocates such as independent advocates), to ensure their
            health, safety and wellbeing.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Leadership Team must promote best practice,
            continuous improvement and a service delivery culture that promotes
            and supports Participant safety. This will be assessed in yearly
            Performance Reviews of Leadership Team staff.
          </p>

            training is provided to staff where required.
          </p>

          <p class="textCenter">
            <img src="images/incident_identification.jpg" />
          </p>

          <p>Strategies to respond appropriately to incidents include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              recognising and acknowledging the impact of the incident on the
              Participant;
            </li>
            <li>
              assuring the Participant the incident will be taken seriously and
              dealt with in a fair and equitable manner;
            </li>
            <li>
              clearly educating the Participant about their rights and
              considering their wishes;
            </li>
            <li>
              keeping the Participant informed of the progress, outcome and any
              follow-up of incidents;
            </li>
            <li>
              if appropriate, identifying an advocate or support person and
              helping the Participant to contact them;
            </li>
            <li>
              involving the Participant in the process of reviewing or
              investigating the incident, including the taking their account of
              what happened, with communication support if required; and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring the Participant has the opportunity to provide feedback
              on the response to the incident.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Notifying Next of Kin or Guardian</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager must notify the Participant’s next of kin or guardian
            where the Participant:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              consents to their next of kin or guardian being contacted. If the
              Participant is unable to make an informed decision regarding
              contact and does not have an appointed guardian, the Manager
              should contact the next of kin if they believe it is appropriate;
              or
            </li>
            <li>has a legal guardian.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Manager must explain to the next of kin or guardian: the nature
            of the allegation; the standard procedure for reporting allegations
            to the police; that the Participant may choose whether or not to
            participate in the police investigation; and any action taken by
            staff since reporting the allegation.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the alleged perpetrator is the Participant’s next of kin or legal
            guardian, the Manager must ensure the immediate needs of the
            Participant are protected. They should work with the police or other
            relevant support agencies to ensure an appropriate, planned response
            is undertaken.

          <p>
            Reports of abuse or neglect of a Participant in a Supported
            Independent Living or other accommodation setting may also need to
            be reported to the NSW Ombudsman. To determine if a notification
            must be made to the NSW Ombudsman, refer to the NSW Ombudsman’s
            Guide for Services: Reportable incidents in Disability Supported
            Group Accommodation or call its inquiry line on 02 9286 0907.
          </p>

          <p>Otherwise, a report must be made to Child Safety Services:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              during normal business hours through a Regional Intake Service.
              Contact details for local services are provided at -
              https://www.csyw.qld.gov.au/contact-us/department-contacts/child-family-contacts/child-safety-service-centres/regional-intake-services;
            </li>
            <li>
              after hours and on weekends through the Child Safety After Hours
              Service Centre on 1800 177 135 or (07) 3235 9999. The service
              operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
              (https://www.csyw.qld.gov.au/contact-us/department-contacts/child-family-contacts/child-safety-service-centres);
              or
            </li>
            <li>
              by visiting a Child Safety Service Centre. Contact details are

            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff must be aware that, legally, their duty of care obligations to
            a child don’t end once they have reported their concerns – meaning
            that they still need to take all reasonable steps to protect the
            child once they have made a report.
          </p>

          <h3>Investigating Incidents</h3>

          <p>The options for investigating incidents are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>No further investigative action</strong> – This may be
              appropriate where it can be clearly established that the report of
              the incident is inaccurate or there is no basis for concern about
              the safety of the Participant or the quality of care the
              Participant is receiving. If the decision is not to undertake an
              investigation, the grounds for this decision must be supported and
              recorded with reasoning backed up by evidence. The incident must
              then be the subject of a review (detailed below).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Monitoring and support required </strong>– Certain
              information may raise issues that do not necessarily warrant an
              investigation, but nevertheless require changes in practices.
              Wagtail Services may manage these issues by monitoring and
              supporting affected staff members or Participants, and documenting
              this on relevant staff and Participant files. The incident must
              then be the subject of a review (detailed below).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Internal investigation</strong> – This option may be
              selected only where Wagtail Services has the capability to
              undertake an investigation independently.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>External investigation </strong>– In other cases, Wagtail
              Services will need to commission an investigation by an external
              party to ensure the investigation is robust, objective and expert.
              The Investigation Manager may commission an investigator, or a
              person from another organisation, with relevant expertise.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Regardless of the type of incident or investigation method used,
            incident investigation must focus on the incident only. All parties
            involved in an incident must be provided with procedural fairness
            and with the support and information necessary to participate in the
            investigation process.
          </p>

          <p>
            For every Reportable Incident, or where an investigation is ordered
            by the NDIS Commission, the Manager must appoint an Investigation
            Manager to determine the appropriate investigative action for an
            incident and oversee the incident’s investigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Investigation Manager must determine the appropriate
            investigative action for all incidents within a maximum of 72 hours
            of Wagtail Services becoming aware of the incident. The
            Investigation Manager may seek advice from other staff members if
            appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Investigations must take a person-centred and rights-based approach,
            taking into account what is important to the person with disability
            impacted by the incident. The person and their supporters should be
            invited to participate in the investigation and be provided the
            support they need to do so. The investigation must, however, remain
            impartial and independent at all times.
          </p>

          <p>
            All investigations must be completed (including report finalisation)
            within 28 working days.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must provide information on investigation progress
            and outcomes to the person with disability involved in the incident
            (or their supporters) and, with the consent of the person with
            disability or their representative, any other person.
          </p>

          <p>
            An investigation report must be completed by the Investigation
            Manager. A report may also need to be provided to the NDIS
            Commission within 60 business days of the initial notification, via
            reportableincidents@ndiscommission.gov.au.
          </p>

          <p>Investigation reports should include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              details of any internal or external investigation or assessment
              that has been undertaken in relation to the incident, including:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the name and position of the person who undertook the
                  investigation;
                </li>
                <li>when the investigation was undertaken;</li>
                <li>details of any findings made; and</li>
                <li>
                  details of any corrective or other action taken after the
                  investigation;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              a copy of any report of the investigation or assessment; and
            </li>
            <li>
              whether the person affected by the incident (or their supporter)
              has been kept informed of the progress, findings and actions
              relating to the investigation or assessment.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The NDIS Commissioner may take further action based on the outcome
            of an investigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once any actions required as a follow-up to the investigation have
            been implemented, the Investigation Manager can complete the
            incident investigation.
          </p>

          <h3>Communication</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must provide timely feedback to anyone who reports
            an incident, raises concerns or makes a complaint about harm to
            another person. Feedback must be provided as soon as possible and
            within 7 days from the incident occurring.
          </p>

          <p>
            If an incident cannot be responded to in full within 7 days, an
            update must be provided. This should include the date by which a
            full response can be expected. The update should be provided
            verbally in the first instance then confirmed in writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager should discuss the outcome of an incident investigation
            verbally with those involved, where possible. This must be followed
            by written advice that provides people the opportunity to make
            further contact with the Manager if required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The written advice must also include information on what further
            action may be available or taken at the conclusion of the incident
            investigation. This may include escalating the matter further with
            an external agency or seeking a further review within the business.
            Written advice should also seek feedback from the person regarding
            their experience of the incident management process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Support must be provided to assist people’s understanding of
            correspondence regarding incidents, where this is required (e.g.
            interpreters, referral to advocates, etc.).
          </p>

          <h3>Incident Review</h3>

          <p>
            Incident review includes identifying, monitoring and acting upon
            trends and systemic issues identified through the analysis of
            incident information. The purpose of analysing incident data is to
            learn from patterns of incidents in order to safeguard the safety
            and wellbeing of individual Participants, as well as improve the
            quality of supports.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Incident Register must be reviewed at monthly Leadership Team
            meetings. The Manager is responsible for monitoring the Incident
            Register in order to analyse and report on incident trends.
          </p>

          <p>Reviews should consider:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>the causes, handling and outcomes of incidents;</li>
            <li>
              processes, timeframes and record keeping practices associated with
              incident management; and
            </li>
            <li>
              feedback provided by staff and Participants about incidents.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where preventative or improvement measures are identified, these
            must be tracked in the Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>

          <h3>Ongoing Support</h3>

          <p>
            After a serious and traumatic incident, it is likely that high
            levels of stress will be experienced by those connected with the
            incident.
          </p>

          <p>
            General arrangements to support Participants may include allocating
            a safe place for retreat and communicating with and supporting them
            and their families.
          </p>

          <p>
            It may also be appropriate to undertake a Quality of Support review.
            Agreed actions for the Participant’s immediate and ongoing needs
            should be recorded on the Participant’s Support Plan. These might
            include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              steps being taken to assure the Participant’s safety and wellbeing
              in the future;
            </li>
            <li>
              treatment or counselling the Participant and their family may
              access to address their safety and wellbeing;
            </li>
            <li>
              modifications in the way services are provided (for example, same
              gender carer);
            </li>
            <li>
              how best to support the Participant and their family through any
              action the Participant takes to seek justice or redress, including
              making a report to police; and
            </li>
            <li>any ongoing risk management strategy required.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Participants have a right to complain about Wagtail Services’
            services and should be alerted to Wagtail Services’ Feedback and
            Complaints Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            General arrangements to support staff may include allocating a safe
            place for retreat, giving staff the option of being immediately and
            temporarily relieved of their duties, providing communication with
            families and offering to organise transport home.
          </p>

          <h3>Sexual Abuse</h3>

          <p>
            Irrespective of gender, victims of sexual assault frequently
            experience negative outcomes including dissociation, posttraumatic
            stress disorder, depression and anxiety. Victims of physical assault
            also frequently experience shock, numbness, fear, depression and
            anxiety. In recognition of this, after an allegation of abuse,
            additional support and/or a review of supports provided to the
            Participant may be required.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators of Abuse</h3>

          <p>Indicators of abuse include but are not limited to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a Participant alleges that abuse has occurred, by a staff member,
              another Participant, or other person;
            </li>
            <li>a staff member observes or is told about alleged abuse;</li>
            <li>
              a staff member suspects that abuse has occurred (for example, a
              Participant may have unexplained injuries, a Participant may be
              distressed or anxious, or clothes may have been ripped);
            </li>
            <li>
              a Participant’s behaviour changes significantly (this might
              include self-destructive behaviour, sleep disturbances, acting-out
              behaviour, emotional distress, or persistent and inappropriate
              sexual behaviour); and
            </li>
            <li>
              a Participant complains of physical symptoms or a staff member
              observes symptoms (this might include bruising, abdominal pain,
              sexually transmitted disease or pregnancy).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Responding to Allegations of Sexual Abuse</h3>

          <p>
            Suspicions and allegations of abuse should always be treated
            seriously. The person’s feelings about themselves may be influenced
            by initial reactions to their suspicion and/or allegation.
          </p>

          <p>
            If abuse is disclosed, or a staff member is suspicious of abuse, or
            becomes aware of abuse, a helpful response may include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              ensuring their immediate safety, health and wellbeing needs are
              met;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring their specific support needs are addressed including
              access to communication aides and resources;
            </li>
            <li>listening carefully to them;</li>
            <li>
              reassuring them they did the right thing by telling someone;
            </li>
            <li>
              asking them what can be done to make them feel safe and explaining
              the actions you will take next;
            </li>
            <li>
              with their consent, or if they are a child, engaging family,
              significant others or an advocate to support them and advocate on
              their behalf; and
            </li>
            <li>
              with their consent, notifying other service providers working with
              them, if appropriate.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Interpreting</h3>

          <p>
            For Participants who are from culturally and linguistically diverse
            or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, staff should
            consider referring them to specialist agencies or staff for
            additional support. It may also be necessary to arrange an
            interpreter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some victims may be reluctant to speak to an interpreter because
            they fear that what they say may be passed on to their local
            community. In this case, it is possible to request a telephone
            interpreter from another state, or to not disclose the victim’s name
            to the interpreter.
          </p>

          <p>
            When using an interpreter directly, consideration should be given to
            arranging an interpreter who is not associated with the Participant
            or their immediate cultural community.
          </p>

          <h3>Specialist Support</h3>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants receive appropriate support, staff should
            consider contacting specialist victim support services including
            crisis care, counselling, advocacy, legal and advice services.

          <h3>Dealing with the Police</h3>

          <p>
            While it is acknowledged that some discussion with the Participant
            may be required to establish safety and a basic understanding of
            what has occurred, under no circumstances should anyone but the
            police interview the Participant about an allegation of abuse.
          </p>

          <h3>Advising Parties Involved of Police Report</h3>

          <p>
            The staff member who first becomes aware of an allegation must
            advise the person that the allegation will be reported to the
            police.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff should check with police whether the alleged perpetrator
            should be told of the report to police. It is important that any
            steps taken do not undermine police action.
          </p>

          <h3>Assisting the Police</h3>

          <p>
            The police should be assisted to conduct their investigation. Where
            an investigation requires the police to take photographs of any
            physical injuries, staff may need to explain this to the victim.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must make all reasonable efforts to preserve evidence of
            sexual assault. This includes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              encouraging the victim not to shower or change, or, if the victim
              feels they must shower or change, ask them to put the clothing
              they were wearing at the time of the assault in bags, which should
              be sealed, labelled and secured; and
            </li>
            <li>
              where possible, lock the door to the room or restrict access to
              the area where the assault occurred so any physical evidence
              inside that area remains undisturbed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It is not necessary for a victim to decide immediately about whether
            to be involved in a police investigation and/or prosecution. People
            may be distraught in the immediate aftermath of an assault and
            sometimes change their minds later.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some evidence, however, will only be present in the immediate period
            following assault. Forensic evidence collected at this time will
            assist police investigation, should the victim wish to proceed at a
            later stage.
          </p>

            Leadership Team. Reviews will incorporate staff, Participant and

            Participant satisfaction surveys, will assess:
          </p>

          <ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Continuous Improvement Register will be used to
            record improvements identified and monitor the progress of their
            implementation. Where relevant, this information will be considered
            as part of Wagtail Services’ service planning and delivery processes
          </p>
