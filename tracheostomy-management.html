          <h2>Background and Definitions</h2>

          <h3>General Medical Information:</h3>

          <p>
            Tracheostomy management encompasses the care and maintenance of a
            tracheostomy, a surgically created opening in the neck leading
            directly to the trachea (windpipe). This procedure is often
            necessary for individuals who require long-term ventilation support,
            have obstructed upper airways, or need frequent suctioning of
            respiratory secretions. Proper tracheostomy management is crucial to
            prevent complications such as infection, blockage of the
            tracheostomy tube, and damage to the trachea. It involves routine
            cleaning, suctioning, changing of the tracheostomy tube, and
            monitoring for signs of complications.
          </p>

            during a tracheostomy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Suctioning:</strong> The process of removing mucus and

            tracheostomy tube when it is no longer needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cuff Pressure Management:</strong> Regulating the pressure
            of the inflatable cuff on some tracheostomy tubes to ensure it is
            effective in providing ventilation support and preventing
            aspiration, yet not so high as to cause tracheal damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tracheostomy Care:</strong> Routine care and maintenance of
            the tracheostomy site and tube, including cleaning and changing
            dressings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Humidification:</strong> The process of adding moisture to
            the air breathed in through the tracheostomy tube to prevent drying
            of the respiratory tract.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Passy-Muir Valve:</strong> A type of speaking valve that can

          <p>
            <strong>Tracheostomy Weaning:</strong> Gradually decreasing
            dependence on a tracheostomy, eventually leading to decannulation.
          </p>

            breathing, oxygenation, and the effectiveness of ventilation through
            the tracheostomy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Aspiration Precautions:</strong> Measures taken to prevent
            the entry of liquids or other materials into the lungs through the
            tracheostomy.
