          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

          <p>
            This policy and procedure outlines Wagtail Services’ approach to
            encouraging and enabling Participants to make decisions, having
            regard for dignity of risk in relation to those decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            It applies to all potential and existing Wagtail Services
            Participants, their family members, carers and other supporters and
            meets relevant legislation, regulations and Standards as set out in
            Schedule 1, Legislative References.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Independence and Informed Choice</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant is supported by the provider to make informed
            choices, exercise control and maximise their independence relating
            to the supports provided.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Active decision-making and individual choice is supported for each
              Participant including the timely provision of information using
              the language, mode of communication and terms that the Participant
              is most likely to understand.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Participant’s right to the dignity of risk in decision-making
              is supported. When needed, each Participant is supported to make
              informed choices about the benefits and risks of the options under
              consideration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Participant’s autonomy is respected, including their right to
              intimacy and sexual expression.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Participant has sufficient time to consider and review their
              options and seek advice if required, at any stage of support
              provision, including assessment, planning, provision, review and
              exit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Participant’s right to access an advocate (including an
              independent advocate) of their choosing is supported, as is their
              right to have the advocate present.
            </li>
          </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
              acts at the direction of the person with disability, reflecting

          <p>
            <strong>Nominee</strong> - a person appointed in writing, at the
            request of a Participant, their guardian, or the NDIA, to act on
            behalf of, or make decisions on behalf of a Participant. Under the
            NDIS, there are 2 types of nominee, a Plan Nominee and
            Correspondence Nominee. One person can be appointed as both and
            either type can be appointed indefinitely or for a specified term.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Correspondence Nominees</strong> make requests to the NDIA
            (for example, requests for information) and receive notices from the
            NDIA, on behalf of a Participant.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Plan Nominees</strong> act on behalf of a Participant in
            relation to the preparation, review or replacement of the
            Participant’s plan or the management of funding under the
            Participant’s plan. In some cases, the NDIA may limit the matters
            that a Plan Nominee is appointed to deal with.

          <p>
            <strong>Participant-appointed Decision-maker</strong> - a person who
            is able to make a decision on a Participant’s behalf under a formal
            arrangement between that person and the Participant (for instance, a
            Power of Attorney, an Advance Health Directive or an Enduring
            Guardian).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Power of Attorney</strong> - a document appointing a person
            (called ‘the Attorney’) to act on behalf of the person who gives the
            power (called the ‘Principal’). The Attorney can make decisions
            about the Principal’s property or financial affairs. An Attorney
            cannot be used to make medical or lifestyle decisions for a
            Principal, although an ‘Enduring Guardian’ or Medical or Health
            Attorney (available in some jurisdictions) can make such decisions.
            There are two main types of Powers of Attorney:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Enduring Power of Attorney</strong> – continues to have
            effect after the Principal loses capacity to make financial
            decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>General Power of Attorney</strong> – ceases to have effect
            after the Principal loses their capacity to make financial

          <h2>Principles</h2>

          <p>
            All staff must be familiar with the object and principles of the
            NDIS as set out in the NDIS Act 2013 (Cth). The following principles
            are particularly relevant to this policy and procedure:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              people with disability should be supported to exercise choice,
              including in relation to taking reasonable risks, in the pursuit
              of their goals and the planning and delivery of their supports;
            </li>
            <li>
              people with disability have the same right as other members of
              Australian society to be able to determine their own best
              interests, including the right to exercise choice and control, and
              to engage as equal partners in decisions that will affect their
              lives, to the full extent of their capacity;
            </li>
            <li>
              people with disability should be supported in all their dealings
              and communications with the NDIA so that their capacity to
              exercise choice and control is maximised in a way that is
              appropriate to their circumstances and cultural needs;
            </li>
            <li>
              the role of families, carers and other significant persons in the
              lives of people with disability is to be acknowledged and
              respected; and
            </li>
            <li>
              where acts or things are done on behalf of a person or child with
              disability:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  they should be involved in decision-making that affects them,
                  including making decisions for themselves, to the extent
                  possible;
                </li>
                <li>
                  they should be encouraged to engage in the life of the
                  community;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the judgements and decisions they would have made for
                  themselves should be taken into account;
                </li>
                <li>
                  their cultural and linguistic circumstances, and gender,
                  should be taken into account; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  their supportive relationships, friendships and connections
                  with others should be recognised.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services is committed to ensuring all Participants are
            involved in making decisions and choices about all aspects of the
            support services they receive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services works with its Participants on the presumption that
            they have decision making capacity. In the first instance,
            Participants should be the person making informed decisions and
            choices about the services they receive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services works with its Participants on the presumption that
            they have a need for human connection and intimacy like everyone
            else and need to be the person making informed decisions and choices
            about their relationships.
          </p>

          <p>
            If required, staff must support, and build the capacity of,
            Participants to make their own decisions. Staff must consider the
            Participant’s Dignity of Risk and their own Duty of Care when
            supporting Participants to make decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services recognises that a person’s decision-making capacity
            can be lost, temporarily or permanently, or regained and that even
            if a person lacks capacity with regard to some decisions, this does
            not mean that they lack decision-making ability in all situations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services does recognise that some Participants will have a
            support person, representative, family member or advocate to assist
            them to make a decision or choice, or to make a choice on their
            behalf. They may also have a nominee, court-appointed decision maker
            and/or Participant-appointed decision maker who is appointed to make
            decisions regarding certain aspects of their life or NDIS service
            provision.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants understand their rights regarding decision
            making, Wagtail Services uses its Participant Charter, Participant
            Handbook to provide Participants, families, carers and all other
            stakeholders with information about this policy and procedure, in an
            easy to understand format.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants understand this information, staff must
            provide information to them and their supporters in ways that suit
            their individual communication needs. Written information can be
            provided Easy English or explained verbally by staff. Staff can also
            help Participants access interpreters or advocates where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must advise Participants or their representatives or families
            when making appointments for an initial assessment and subsequent
            reviews that they are entitled to have a support person at the
            meeting to assist them in the decision-making process. Staff will
            bring information in Wagtail Services’ Participant Handbook about
            independent advocacy and agencies that can assist with this process
            to the Participant’s or family member’s attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            When requested by Participants or their representatives, staff must
            contact their advocates, support people or other representatives,
            giving them the day, date and time of meetings Participants would
            like them to attend.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must support Participants and their representatives to access
            any information they reasonably require to enable them to
            participate in decision-making. This includes supporting them to
            access technology, aids, equipment and services that increase and
            enhance their decision-making and independence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must be responsive to the changing needs, goals, aspirations
            and choices of Participants and communicate in appropriate formats
            to facilitate their informed decision-making and choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must also recognise that the support a person needs to make a
            decision will vary: it may decrease over time as people gain
            experience or confidence and may increase as the type of decisions
            become more important.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where Wagtail Services is unable to meet the needs and goals of a
            Participant, staff should refer the person to other relevant service
            providers as per the Providing Information, Advice and Referral
            Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Services’ Human Resources Policy and Procedure, all
            staff must undergo initial training and orientation, which includes
            training in responding to the needs of Participants, Participant
            decision making, dignity of risk and assisting Participants to make
            informed choices. Staff knowledge and application of this policy and
            procedure is monitored on a day-to-day basis and through annual
            Performance Reviews. Additional formal and on-the-job training is
            provided to staff where required.
          </p>

          <h3>Dignity of Risk</h3>

          <p>
            Where a Participant has the capacity for decision making and wants
            to try new things or continue with options that may not have gone
            well in the past, all options, risks and possible consequences must
            be discussed with them and all relevant stakeholders involved in the
            decision-making process. If a decision doesn’t place anyone at risk
            of harm, staff must comply with the Participant's decision.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must recognise the opinions of those who are important in the
            lives of people with a disability. However, this should not
            compromise the right of the person with a disability to have the
            final say in their decision.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where there is disagreement about a decision based on a different
            view of the risk involved or the potential for harm, the emphasis
            should be on assisting the person to understand and obtain
            information about the risks and any mitigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Important decisions where firm disagreement exists (between, for
            example, the person and their parents) must be referred to the
            Manager, who may need to arrange independent mediation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any staff member who believes they cannot agree with a person’s
            decision because of their own values should refer the matter to the
            Manager. The staff member may need to withdraw from supporting the
            person in the particular activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Access to supports required by the Participant must not be withdrawn
            or denied solely on the basis of a dignity of risk choice that has
            been made by the Participant.
          </p>

          <h3>Duty of Care</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services and all staff must ensure that reasonable action is
            taken to minimise the risk of harm to anyone who is likely to be
            affected by supports they deliver.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services also has a duty to ensure a safe and healthy
            workplace for staff, the people they support and visitors. Some
            choices by people with a disability may potentially expose staff to
            risk, particularly with regard to Work Health and Safety.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must consider the risks and benefits of a decision and any
            strategies to reduce the impact of any risk. Any restriction of a
            Participant’s choice or actions based on an unacceptable level of
            risk to the person, staff or others must be documented on the
            Participant’s file, including the reasons and strategies considered
            to reduce or manage the risk. Where staff are unsure about whether a
            decision presents an unacceptable level of risk, they must consult
            the Manager.
          </p>

          <h3>Autonomy</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services and all staff must demonstrate respect for the
            personal autonomy of Participants, including the right to intimacy
            and sexual expression.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will be proactive in providing opportunities for
            mixed gender interaction which is important to develop confidence
            and social skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            Barriers to forming social, intimate and sexual relationships may
            include: physical and/or cognitive limitations of Participants;
            limited social opportunities and lack of privacy; attitudes of
            significant others who regard intimacy and sexual expression as not
            important or appropriate for the Participant; lack of knowledge
            about intimacy and sexuality. Wagtail Services will work with
            Participants to find ways to overcome these barriers, including
            support to access mainstream supports and other services to assist
            them to increase social capacity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services respects the rights of Participants to form
            meaningful relationships that are based on consent, respect and
            safety, and to allow Participants to control decisions which affect
            their sexual and reproductive health and relationships as much as
            possible.
          </p>

          <h3>Substitute Decision Making</h3>

          <h4>Informal substitute decision-making</h4>

          <p>
            Informal decision-making is where a person making a decision on
            behalf of another person has not been legally appointed. People who
            can make informal decisions include the person’s family, friends,
            carer or nominated support.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most decisions can be made informally, including decisions about who
            a person wishes to see, their work, leisure, recreation, holidays or
            accessing services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must ensure that all informal decision-making arrangements are
            clearly recorded on the Participant’s file and communicated to other
            relevant staff. Decisions can then be pursued through the agreed
            informal arrangements.
          </p>
          <h4>Formal substitute decision-making</h4>

          <p>
            Formal decision-making arrangements must be implemented when
            informal decision-making is insufficient, such as when:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              there is conflict over decisions being made about the person;
            </li>
            <li>
              where specific legislative requirements exist (e.g. consent to
              medical treatment); or
            </li>
            <li>
              where the person has a legal Guardian, Administrator or appointed
              nominee or decision maker.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Formal arrangements should take a rights-based approach and consider
            the Participant’s individual wishes as much as possible regardless
            of their impaired decision-making capacity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must record and maintain information about formal
            decision-making arrangements on Participant files. Any amendments to
            a person’s decision-making arrangements must be clearly recorded and
            communicated to relevant staff as soon as practicable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must refer any issues relating to formal decision making to
            the Manager.
          </p>

          <h2>Supporting documents</h2>

          <p>Documents relevant to this policy and procedure include:</p>

            Leadership Team. Reviews will incorporate staff, Participant and
            other stakeholder feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ feedback collection mechanisms, such as
            Participant satisfaction surveys, will assess:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Participant awareness of their rights and the extent to which they
              feel able and supported to exercise them;
            </li>
            <li>
              Participant satisfaction with Wagtail Services’ complaints
              processes; and
            </li>
            <li>
              whether Participants are satisfied with the choices they are
              provided regarding their service delivery.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Continuous Improvement Register will be used to
            record improvements identified and monitor the progress of their
            implementation. Where relevant, this information will be considered
            as part of Wagtail Services’ service planning and delivery
            processes.
