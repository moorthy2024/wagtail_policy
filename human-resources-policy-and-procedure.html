          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Each Participant’s support needs are met
            by workers who are competent in relation to their role, hold
            relevant qualifications, and who have relevant expertise and
            experience to provide person-centred support.

          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The skills and knowledge required of each position within a
              provider are identified and documented together with the
              responsibilities, scope and limitations of each position.

              effectiveness of training and education for workers is in place to
              ensure that workers meet the needs of each Participant. The system
              identifies training that is mandatory and includes training in
              relation to staff obligations under the NDIS Practice Standards
              and other National Disability Insurance Scheme rules.
            </li>

            service, Wagtail Services must screen selected staff, volunteers and
            other people conducting work on behalf of the business.
          </p>

          <p>
            The mandatory screening checks applicable to Wagtail Services’ staff
            are:
          </p>

          <p>The Manager is responsible for:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>assessing whether a staff member needs a check;</li>
            <li>determining who will cover the costs of checks;</li>
            <li>
              maintaining a record for all Wagtail Services staff including
              their qualifications, registrations, training and criminal history
              check status. These must have been sighted and recorded in each
              staff record; and
            </li>
            <li>
              maintaining a Criminal History Screening Register that contains
              Clearance Numbers, Expiry Dates and Currency Status for all checks
              for all staff.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must provide an opportunity for prospective staff
            and volunteers to disclose any criminal record or disciplinary
            actions as part of the recruitment process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Employment contracts will stipulate that all staff are obligated to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              advise the Manager if they are charged with a criminal offence
              which is punishable by imprisonment or, if found guilty, could
              reasonably affect their ability to meet the inherent requirements
              of their job; and
            </li>
            <li>
              disclose formal disciplinary action taken against them by any
              current or former employer, including findings of improper or
              unprofessional conduct by a Court or Tribunal and investigations
              the staff member has been the subject of.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Prior to checks being undertaken, the person being checked must:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>consent to Wagtail Services undertaking checks; and</li>
            <li>
              sign a statutory declaration stating they have fully disclosed all
              relevant information regarding their criminal record and
              employment history to Wagtail Services.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>NDIS Worker Screening Checks</h3>

          <p>
            The NDIS Worker Screening Check is comprised of a national criminal
            history check as well as assessment of workplace misconduct
            information from the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
            (identified through complaints and serious incident reporting). The
            NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission maintains a National
            Clearance Database that is continuously monitored to ensure workers
            who pose a risk to people with disability are identified.
          </p>

          <p>
            Only staff involved in NDIS support delivery are subject to the NDIS
            Worker Screening Check and not all staff will require one. Checks
            must be conducted for staff who:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>are key personnel;</li>
            <li>
              are in a role where they deliver NDIS supports or services set out
              in the NDIS Commission’s List of Specified Services and Supports;
              or
            </li>
            <li>
              are in a role where their normal duties are likely to require more
              than incidental contact with people with disability.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If staff have only incidental contact with people with disability as
            a normal part of their jobs (for example, administrative support
            staff), it is not mandatory for them to have a check, however,
            Wagtail Services may still require them to get one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Roles that require NDIS Worker Screening Checks are known as
            <strong>Risk Assessed Roles</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>Risk Assessed Roles</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must document the details of its Risk Assessed
            Roles. This information must include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>the title or another identifier used for that role;</li>
            <li>a description of the role;</li>
            <li>the reasons why the role is a risk assessed role;</li>
            <li>who made the risk assessment and when it was made;</li>
            <li>
              the name, date of birth and address of the worker engaged in that
              role;
            </li>
            <li>whether or not the worker is eligible for an exemption;</li>
            <li>
              the application number, check number, and outcome expiry date;
            </li>
            <li>
              records relating to an interim bar, suspension, exclusion or any
              action taken by the provider in relation to those decisions; and
            </li>
            <li>
              allegations of misconduct against a worker with a clearance and
              the action taken by the provider in response to that allegation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Records about Risk Assessed Roles must be kept for seven years from
            the date the record was made.
          </p>

          <h3>Applying for NDIS Worker Screening Checks</h3>

          <p>
            The NDIS Worker Screening Check is being introduced nationally on 01
            February, 2021. Until then, Wagtail Services must comply with
            interim worker screening arrangements.
          </p>

          <p><u>No Card, No Start</u></p>

          <p>
            All staff and volunteers must await the outcome of their screening
            check and have a positive notice and Yellow Card issued before they
            can commence duties.
          </p>

          <p><u>Negative Notices</u></p>

          <p>The Manager will:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              ensure prospective staff or volunteers issued with a Negative
              Notice are not engaged by Wagtail Services;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure existing staff or volunteers issued with a Negative Notice
              have their engagement terminated; and
            </li>
            <li>
              periodically check the status of all staff and volunteers’ Yellow
              and Blue Cards.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Staff and volunteers must inform Wagtail Services immediately if
            they have been issued with an Interim Negative Notice or Negative
            Notice, or if they have a relevant change in circumstances.
          </p>

          <p><u>Staff and Volunteers Engaged by More Than One Provider </u></p>

          <p>
            If a person has already undergone criminal history screening in the
            previous three years, they may show their positive notice or Yellow
            Card as evidence. In this case, Wagtail Services does not need to
            submit an application for screening. However, the Manager must
            contact the Department of Communities, Disability Services and
            Seniors to confirm the positive notice and Yellow Card are current,
            using the Department’s
            <u
              >Application for Information from Register of Engaged Persons
              Form</u
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>Exemptions</h3>

          <p>
            High school students on work experience are not required to obtain
            an NDIS Worker Screening Check, provided they are closely supervised
            by a person who does have a check.
          </p>

          <h3>Screening Outcomes</h3>

          <p><u>Clearance</u></p>

          <p>
            A clearance allows a person to work with people with disability in
            roles that require an NDIS Worker Screening Check.
          </p>
          <p><u>Exclusion</u></p>

          <p>
            Exclusion means an applicant has been refused a clearance. Wagtail
            Services <strong>must not </strong>employ people in roles that
            require a check, if they are excluded as a result of their NDIS
            Worker Screening Check. However, they may still be able to work in
            other roles that do not require a check. Decisions to engage an
            excluded person in a role that doesn’t require a check are the
            responsibility of the Manager.
          </p>

          <p><u>Revocation</u></p>
          <p>
            A revocation is the overturning or cancelling of a clearance, after
            it has been issued.
          </p>

          <p><u>Interim Bar </u></p>

          <p>
            An interim bar is an interim decision to bar a person from working
            with people with a disability, while the person’s application for an
            NDIS Worker Screening Check is being processed. An interim bar is
            used where records indicate an applicant may pose a risk to people
            with disability.
          </p>

          <p><u>Suspension </u></p>

          <p>
            Suspension is a decision to suspend a clearance, meaning that the
            person cannot work in a role requiring a clearance, for the
            suspension period. A worker’s clearance can be suspended if
            monitoring or reassessment reveals they may present a risk to people
            with disability.
          </p>

          <h3>Validity</h3>

          <p>
            NDIS Worker Screening Check clearance, exclusion and revocation
            decisions are valid for five years. Staff cannot reapply for a Check
            within that period except where pending criminal proceedings are
            finalised, and the results mean the person could be deemed suitable.
            Staff can surrender their NDIS Worker Check at any time unless they
            are undergoing assessment or are subject to a suspension.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Engaging someone before they have an NDIS Worker Screening Check (or
            equivalent)
          </h3>

          <p>
            If Wagtail Services chooses to engage someone before a final
            decision has been made about a clearance, it must have appropriate
            safeguards in place, including:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>developing a written risk management plan for safeguarding</li>
            <li>
              people with disability while someone is in the process of
              obtaining a clearance;
            </li>
            <li>
              checking that there are no circumstances that would prevent the
              person from working with people with disability, such as being
              subject to an interim bar, or that they’ve had their application
              closed or withdrawn;
            </li>
            <li>
              checking that the person was not excluded on the most recent
              occasion that they were assessed for an NDIS Worker Screening
              Check;
            </li>
            <li>
              arranging for the person to be supervised by someone else who has
              a clearance; and
            </li>
            <li>
              sighting evidence that an application has been made, and keeping a
              record of the application number.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Engaging subcontractors</h3>

          <p>
            Where Wagtail Services engages another organisation (a
            subcontractor) to perform work that is part of its NDIS service
            delivery, it has additional obligations to meet with respect to NDIS
            Worker Screening. This is because Wagtail Services and the
            subcontractor need to work together to ensure staff of the
            subcontractor are appropriately screened. In these instances,
            Wagtail Services must:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              advise the subcontractor of risk assessed roles that the
              subcontractor’s staff engage in;
            </li>
            <li>
              take reasonable steps to ensure the subcontractor’s staff have
              clearances or an acceptable state-based check;
            </li>
            <li>
              make sure its contract with the subcontractor requires the
              subcontractor to:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  only allow someone to work in a risk assessed role if that
                  person has a clearance or is subject to an exemption;
                </li>
                <li>
                  only allow someone to work in a risk assessed role if the
                  subcontractor is allowed to share information with Wagtail
                  Services about any matter relating to that person’s NDIS
                  Worker Screening Check;
                </li>
                <li>
                  co-operate with any reasonable request to assist Wagtail
                  Services investigate a complaint or reportable incident
                  involving staff engaged in risk assessed roles;
                </li>
                <li>
                  co-operate with any reasonable request from Wagtail Services
                  for information about whether and how they comply with
                  obligations under the contract; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  impose these obligations on any other party they enter into an
                  arrangement with that involves or allows another person to
                  provide services.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The NDIS Commission may require Wagtail Services to provide it with
            information or records provided to Wagtail Services by the
            subcontractor.
          </p>

          <h3>Student Placements</h3>

          <p>
            Secondary school students on a formal work experience program do not
            need a police check to work with people with disability in the NDIS.
            However, they must be directly supervised by someone who does have a
            check.
          </p>

          <p>
            A police check is required for tertiary students aged 18 years and
            older. These checks must be administered by the relevant course
            coordinator in the educational institute or the student can obtain a
            police check through the New South Wales and Queensland Police
            website.
          </p>

          <p>
            For international students or students who have resided in an
            overseas country for 12 months or more in the last ten years, as
            they are only here for a short period, the usual requirement for
            obtaining an international police check (see below) is waived.
            However, they must complete a Statutory Declaration declaring that
            they do not have any charges laid against them by police concerning
            any offence committed in Australia or in another country in the
            past, any offence of which they have been found guilty, committed in
            Australia or in another country in the past.
          </p>

          <h3>International Police Checks</h3>

          <p>
            Prospective staff must be informed at the beginning of recruitment
            processes that if they have resided continuously in an overseas
            country for 12 months or more in the last ten years, they should
            contact the relevant overseas police force to obtain a criminal or
            police record check. If they were a minor when they were overseas,
            they do not require an international police check.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some countries will not release information regarding an individual
            for personal or third-party purposes. In these extenuating cases,
            where an international police records check cannot be obtained, a
            statutory declaration and character reference checks must be
            conducted with at least two individuals who personally knew the
            individual while they were residing in the other country. This
            should be undertaken as a very last resort if the international
            police check is actually unavailable and cannot be obtained.
          </p>

          <p>
            The applicant must be informed that referees will be asked whether
            they have knowledge or information concerning the applicant, which
            would adversely affect the applicant from performing the job,
            including any relevant criminal offences. The credentials of persons
            acting as referees must be verified and can include previous
            employers, government officials and family members.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the case of asylum seekers and refugees who may be unable to
            provide character references to accompany a statutory declaration,
            the statutory declaration will suffice with proof of status.
            However, eligibility to work should be confirmed as part of the
            recruitment process using the Department of Immigration and Border
            Protection’s Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) checking
            system at http://www.border.gov.au/VEVO.
          </p>

          <h3>Results of the Police Record Check</h3>

          <p>
            Information released as part of a police record check is restricted
            according to the relevant legislation or release policies operating
            in the specific police jurisdiction. Where the police record check
            reveals no disclosable court outcomes, outstanding charges or other
            matters, their appointment may be confirmed.
          </p>

          <p>
            An applicant should not automatically be precluded from a job or
            placement on the basis of having a police record. However, if a
            person’s national police history includes a serious offence, the
            individual <strong>must not</strong> be engaged in any Participant
            contact role.
          </p>

          <p>
            In all other cases, the Manager will manage the assessment process
            in order to determine the applicant's suitability for employment or
            placement. The Manager will ensure that:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the applicant, student or volunteer confirms that the details of
              the disclosable record are correct;
            </li>
            <li>
              assessment of any disclosable record of the applicant, volunteer
              or student is made in accordance with the assessment criteria
              detailed below; and
            </li>
            <li>
              any decision made for or against a person is able to be justified
              and is fully documented.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Manager should give consideration to the following criteria:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the relevance of the criminal offence, in relation to the job or
              placement;
            </li>
            <li>
              the nature of the offence and the relationship of the offence to
              the particular job or placement for which the applicant is being
              considered;
            </li>
            <li>the length of time since the offence took place;</li>
            <li>
              whether the person was convicted or found guilty and placed on a
              bond;
            </li>
            <li>whether there is evidence of an extended police record;</li>
            <li>
              the number of offences committed which may establish a pattern of
              behaviour which renders the applicant unsuitable;
            </li>
            <li>
              whether the offence was committed as an adult or a juvenile;
            </li>
            <li>the severity of punishment imposed;</li>
            <li>
              whether the offence is still a crime, that is, has the offence now
              been decriminalised;
            </li>
            <li>
              whether there are other factors that may be relevant for
              consideration; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the person's general character since the offence was committed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Where the Manager makes the decision not to take on an applicant,
            volunteer or student with a disclosable record, they must:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              inform the unsuccessful applicant of the decision and its
              rationale;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide an opportunity for the unsuccessful applicant to discuss
              the results; and
            </li>
            <li>
              inform the unsuccessful applicant of the opportunity for the
              decision to be reviewed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Working with Children Check</h3>

          <p>
            WWC Checks are valid for 5 years and assess the level of risk an
            individual poses to children's safety. They are more extensive and
            targeted than Police Checks and consist of a national criminal
            history check and a review of findings of workplace misconduct.
          </p>

          <p>
            All Wagtail Services staff, contractors or volunteers who have any
            contact with children in the course of their duties must have and
            maintain a clear WWC check.
          </p>

          <p>The Manager will:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              ensure staff or volunteers issued with a Negative Notice do not
              undertake child-related work; and
            </li>
            <li>
              periodically go to the NSW Office of the Children’s Guardian
              website and check the status of all staff and volunteers with WWC
              Check cards using the Verify function.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Staff and volunteers must:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              inform Wagtail Services within seven days if they have been issued
              with an Interim Negative Notice or Negative Notice, or if they
              have a relevant change in circumstances; and
            </li>
            <li>
              not engage in child-related work if they have been issued with a
              Negative Notice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>All staff and volunteers engaged in a risk-assessed role must:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              hold a current Blue Card for working with children with
              disability;
            </li>
            <li>
              hold a Yellow Card for working with adults with disability; or
            </li>
            <li>
              hold both a Blue Card and a Yellow Card Exemption if working with
              both children and adults with disability.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It is an offence for someone who has committed a Disqualifying
            Offence to apply for a Blue Card. Anyone who does apply must sign a
            declaration stating they are not a disqualified person. The Manager
            must also warn staff and volunteers that it is an offence for a
            disqualified person to apply for a Blue Card.
          </p>

          <p>
            From 31 August 2020, the ‘No Card, No Start’ system will be
            introduced in Queensland, meaning applicants will not be able to
            commence paid employment while their Blue Card application is
            pending. Wagtail Services must not engage someone without a Blue
            Card. The Manager must also warn staff and volunteers that anyone
            who starts or continues paid employment without a Blue Card could
            face a five-year jail term. The only exception to his is where
            applicants are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>workers of unregistered NDIS Providers; or</li>
            <li>
              workers of Registered NDIS Providers but are working in non-risk
              assessed roles, and already providing services to a Participant.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Workers in these situations who apply for a check will be able to
            continue to work while their applications are being processed. This
            reflects the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission’s position that
            screening of workers in these roles is not mandatory.
          </p>

          <p><u>Negative Notices</u></p>

          <p>The Manager must:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              ensure prospective staff or volunteers issued with a Negative
              Notice are not engaged by Wagtail Services;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure existing staff or volunteers issued with a Negative Notice
              have their engagement terminated; and
            </li>
            <li>
              periodically check the status of all staff and volunteers’ Yellow
              and Blue Cards.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff and volunteers must inform Wagtail Services immediately if
            they have been issued with an Interim Negative Notice or Negative
            Notice, or if they have a relevant change in circumstances.
          </p>

          <p><u>Staff and Volunteers Engaged by More Than One Provider</u></p>

          <p>
            Where a person is engaged by another organisation and already has an
            existing Blue Card, the Manager must link them to Wagtail Services
            by submitting the Department of Justice and Attorney General’s
            <u>Link an Applicant/Cardholder to This Organisation Form</u>.
          </p>

          <h3>Record Keeping and Confidentiality</h3>

          <p>
            Information obtained as part of screening processes must be treated
            with the highest level of confidentiality and privacy in accordance
            with the relevant legislation and standards. Records must be kept
            for a minimum of seven years. See also Wagtail Services’ Privacy and
            Confidentiality and Records and Information Management Policies and
            Procedures.
          </p>

          <h3>Other Checks</h3>

          <p>
            In addition to the Mandatory Checks, the Manager must also confirm
            the identity (through photo identification), qualifications (through
            sighting a copy) and referees of all prospective staff prior to
            their appointment.
          </p>

          <p>
            If qualifications are a mandatory requirement of the role, original
            qualifications must be copied, certified as being a true copy of the
            original and returned to the applicant.
          </p>

          <p>
            If there are doubts about the qualification, the Manager should
            undertake an online check to verify that the qualification was
            awarded to the applicant. If an online check is not possible, the
            applicant should provide a letter from the registrar of the relevant
            institution confirming that the qualification was in fact awarded to
            the applicant. If there are any concerns about the authenticity of
            the qualification as presented, the issuing institution must be
            contacted directly to verify that the particular qualification was
            completed and issued to the relevant applicant on the date
            specified.
          </p>

          <h3>Training and Development</h3>

          <p>
            Records of induction, training and organisational and professional
            development provided to all staff will be kept on each staff record
            as well as in Wagtail Services Training and Development Register.
          </p>

          <h3>Induction</h3>

          <p>
            All new staff must be provided a Staff Handbook, incorporating their
            job description, staff Code of Conduct, an organisation chart
            highlighting their direct supervisor and other relevant information
            to orientate them to Wagtail Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to engaging with Participants, all staff must undergo initial
            training and orientation. This will include (but is not limited to)
            the provision of information and training in:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the mandatory <u>NDIS Worker Orientation Program</u> covering
              human rights, respect, risk, and the roles and responsibilities of
              NDIS workers. The e-learning module is available on the
              <u>NDIS Commission website</u>;
            </li>
            <li>
              the areas listed in Wagtail Services’ Induction Checklist; and
            </li>
            <li>all relevant policies and procedures.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where possible, cultural awareness training will be delivered by
            local A&TSI and CALD groups to ensure it is tailored to the
            organisation's service areas. All staff will be asked to provide
            feedback on the induction process to contribute to Wagtail Services
            continuous improvement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ongoing training will be provided in these areas where required.
          </p>

          <h3>Ongoing Training and Development</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services is committed to ensuring all staff have the
            necessary skills and knowledge to competently undertake their
            duties. Wagtail Services will identify, plan, facilitate, record and
            evaluate the effectiveness of training and development for staff to
            ensure they meet the needs of each Participant.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following mandatory training will be provided to all relevant
            staff each year:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Staff obligations under the NDIS Practice Standards and other NDIS
              Rules;
            </li>
            <li>Child Protection;</li>
            <li>Basic Food Handling;</li>
            <li>Fire Safety Awareness;</li>
            <li>Mandatory Reporting;</li>
            <li>First Aid and CPR;</li>
            <li>Manual Handling;</li>
            <li>Risk Assessment.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In addition to mandatory training, all Leadership Team members and
            staff will have the opportunity to participate in training and
            development activities each year.
          </p>

          <p>
            Training on specific issues or areas will be provided where a need
            is identified, for instance, NDIS information and preparedness
            training; disability and mental health; cultural awareness; LGBTI
            awareness; use of interpreters and translators; and referral and
            support networks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Annual staff Performance Reviews will encourage staff to take an
            active role in their ongoing development by identifying their
            training and development needs in consultation with the Manager.
            Performance Reviews are also an opportunity to assess the
            effectiveness of training provided, identifying any further skills
            gaps or additional training required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager is responsible for overseeing staff training and
            development needs. They will track training undertaken and future
            needs in Wagtail Services’ Staff Training and Development Register.
            Etrainu is our interactive online site for staff training and
            education.
          </p>

          <p>
            All training delivered to staff will be evaluated for effectiveness
            using Wagtail Services’ Training Evaluation Form. Feedback obtained
            from evaluations will be used to inform future training provided to
            staff and improvements identified will be tracked in Wagtail
            Services’ Continuous Improvement Register.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where the Manager decides, in consultation with the Leadership Team,
            that it is necessary for a staff member to acquire a particular
            skill or qualification in order to carry out their duties, Wagtail
            Services will consider being fully responsible for all costs
            incurred for the staff member to attend the training. Where Wagtail
            Services capacity and resources allow, staff will be supported to
            pursue further education or training that will contribute to their
            professional development but is not directly relevant to their
            current position.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will support access to professional development
            opportunities for all staff equitably, taking into account the
            organisation's needs and the needs and skills of staff. Where a
            staff member wishes to pursue further education or professional
            development that is not a requirement for their current position or
            directly relevant to Wagtail Services needs, Wagtail Services will
            not pay for the cost of the staff member's training.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the Manager’s discretion, and taking into account any impact on
            service delivery or other staff, the staff member may be:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              permitted to take annual leave or unpaid leave that would assist
              them to participate in the training; and
            </li>
            <li>
              granted up to two days’ study leave as necessary to attend
              examinations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff must provide Wagtail Services with one months’ notice (where
            possible) of their intentions to participate in training or
            professional development.
          </p>

          <h3>Staff Identification</h3>

          <p>
            It may sometimes be appropriate for Wagtail Services staff members
            to publicly wear identification, including their name, especially
            when on official business with other agencies. If the staff member
            is accompanying a Participant, the staff member will seek the
            Participant’s permission to wear the identification, as the wearing
            of the identification will publicise the worker-client relationship,
            which the Participant may not wish for.
          </p>

          <h3>Staff Management and Retention</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services Leadership Team is responsible for ensuring the
            structure and environment of the organisation promotes cooperative
            work practices and encourages staff and volunteers to take
            responsibility and initiative. Staff performance and retention are
            supported by the following organisational policies and procedures:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Human Resources;</li>
            <li>Financial Management;</li>
            <li>Continuous Improvement;</li>
            <li>Code of Conduct;</li>
            <li>Disputes and Grievances;</li>
            <li>Equity, Anti-Discrimination and Workplace Harassment; and</li>
            <li>Work Health and Safety.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff are expected to attend regular team meetings, where they will
            have access to information sharing, training and development, and
            debrief opportunities.
          </p>

          <p>
            All staff will be provided with initial and ongoing training and
            development opportunities, team building activities and mentoring.
          </p>

          <h3>Performance Reviews</h3>

          <p>
            Performance Reviews will be conducted for all staff on a yearly
            basis. The purpose of Performance Reviews is to ensure staff are
            capable and confident in performing their role, and understand
            Wagtail Services’ policies and procedures. This is also an
            opportunity to discuss with staff their future professional goals
            and how Wagtail Services can support their development.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will notify their staff in writing at least one week in
            advance of the date and time of their Performance Review. Staff must
            complete a Staff Training Needs Self-Assessment before the date of
            the review and take this with them to the interview.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before the interview, the Manager will review the performance of
            their staff over the past year and make preparatory notes. Either
            party can request that a support person be present during the
            meeting.
          </p>

          <p>Performance Reviews will seek to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              clarify any issues relevant to the staff member’s job description
              and performance;
            </li>
            <li>identify the staff member’s strengths;</li>
            <li>identify areas where the staff member needs to improve;</li>
            <li>
              discuss the Staff Training Needs Self-Assessment completed by the
              staff member and any training that will help the staff member
              improve their skills;
            </li>
            <li>
              make changes to the staff member’s Staff Training Needs
              Self-Assessment, where necessary. Both parties must sign this
              document as agreement on the staff member’s training needs;
            </li>
            <li>
              identify and confirm the actions to be taken to maintain, enhance
              or improve performance; and
            </li>
            <li>set future professional goals.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At the conclusion of the meeting, the Manager will complete a Staff
            Performance Review Feedback Form. This will be signed by them and
            the staff member. Where strategies for performance improvement are
            required due to a significant issue, a Staff Performance Improvement
            Plan must be completed and signed by the staff member and the
            Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the Performance Review, any agreed training should be entered
            into a Staff Training Plan for the staff member and signed by both
            the staff member and Manager. A copy of the completed Staff Training
            Plan will be placed on the staff member’s file and a copy given to
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a staff member believes that they have been directly or
            indirectly discriminated against in the performance review, they
            should take action in accordance with Wagtail Services’ Disputes and
            Grievances Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            A copy of all documentation relating to Performance Reviews will be
            retained in the staff member’s employment file.
          </p>

          <h3>Performance Management</h3>

          <p>
            Staff who are not performing satisfactorily, engage in misconduct or
            do not comply with Wagtail Services’ Code of Conduct, Policies and
            Procedures or their Employment Contract may face disciplinary
            action. Wagtail Services’ Manager is responsible for identifying
            problems as soon as they arise and taking action. They must maintain
            records of all performance-related discussions and counselling
            sessions, and these must be kept on staff records.
          </p>

          <p>
            In all processes the principles of natural justice must be followed.
            This means the staff member must have an opportunity to state their
            point of view before action is taken and that the decision maker
            must not be biased. If a staff member engages in serious misconduct
            so that it is unreasonable for Wagtail Services to continue their
            employment, they may be dismissed instantly. Examples of such
            misconduct include theft, assault and fraud. Such action must be
            supported by a high level of evidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other misconduct that may result in disciplinary action includes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>not complying with Wagtail Services’ Code of Conduct;</li>
            <li>
              intentionally causing harm / disregard for the safety and
              wellbeing of themselves or others; and
            </li>
            <li>preventing other staff from carrying out their duties.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If misconduct occurs, the Manager must complete a Misconduct or
            Non-Performance Report detailing relevant incidents and behaviours.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the Manager identifies unsatisfactory performance of a staff
            member, they must advise the staff member. An opportunity must be
            provided for the staff member to improve their performance within a
            reasonable timeframe. This could also include the staff member
            attending training to improve the standard of their performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the staff member’s performance does not improve to the required
            standard after assistance and training has been provided within the
            specified time, the Manager must complete a Misconduct or
            Non-Performance Report outlining specific performance problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will meet with the staff member and inform them that a
            report will be written and they will be provided with a copy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the seriousness of the misconduct or poor performance, the
            following may occur:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Discussion/Counselling – between the Manager and the staff member.
              The problem will be explained and the staff member asked to
              respond. The staff member is entitled to have a support person
              present. If misconduct or non-performance is proved, the Manager
              will advise the staff member of the corrective action they need to
              take. The Manager will record details of the discussion in the
              Misconduct or Non-Performance Report. All parties present must
              sign the report.
            </li>
            <li>
              Written warning - if the incident of misconduct is repeated or
              performance does not improve, the Manager will issue a written
              warning. If the case is considered severe enough, the first
              written warning can also be regarded as the final warning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Final warning - if the problem persists, or the nature of the
              misconduct or poor performance is very serious, the Manager will
              issue a final written warning to the staff member. If the issue is
              not resolved, the Manager may proceed to dismiss the staff member.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The Manager will maintain formal records (Misconduct or
            Non-Performance Reports) of each counselling/disciplinary session
            and keep them confidential. All records must be sighted and signed
            by the relevant staff member as true and correct. Such records will
            provide important evidence if the matter proceeds to the Fair Work
            Commission.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the staff member refuses to sign the record, details of when they
            have been provided a copy and their reason/s for refusal (if given)
            must be noted by the Manager.
          </p>

          <h3>Dismissal</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services must comply with all State and Federal legislation
            and the staff member’s Employment Contract in relation to
            disciplinary action and employment termination. Wagtail Services
            must ensure:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>dismissal is not for an unfair reason;</li>
            <li>
              the staff member knows the reason for dismissal and has an
              opportunity to respond in relation to that reason; and
            </li>
            <li>
              it gives the staff member appropriate notice or compensation in
              lieu of notice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Staff may be dismissed on the basis of:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>their conduct, capacity or performance;</li>
            <li>
              operational requirements, e.g. the position is no longer required;
              or
            </li>
            <li>other reasons sufficient to justify termination.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Exit Interviews</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager will ensure all staff leaving Wagtail Services have the
            opportunity to complete an Exit Interview. Exit interviews are
            voluntary and allow departing staff to offer feedback and
            suggestions that Wagtail Services may use to improve its workplace
            practices, culture and working environment. Staff who are leaving
            will be provided with an Exit Interview Questionnaire to complete
            their Exit Interview, which can be returned to the Manager.
