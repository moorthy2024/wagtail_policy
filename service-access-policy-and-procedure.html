        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

          <p>
            This policy and procedure sets out Wagtail Servicesâ€™ service access
            procedures. These procedures uphold the right of people to access
            appropriate services that meet their needs and that are provided in
            a transparent and equitable way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The policy and procedure applies to all potential and existing
            Participants, their family members, carers and other supporters and
            meets relevant legislation, regulations and Standards as set out in
            Schedule 1, Legislative References.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Access to Supports</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant accesses the most appropriate supports that meet
            their needs, goals and preferences.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The supports available, and any access / entry criteria (including
              any associated costs) are clearly defined and documented. This
              information is communicated to each Participant using the
              language, mode of communication and terms that the Participant is
              most likely to understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reasonable adjustments to the support delivery environment are
              made and monitored to ensure it is fit for purpose and each
              Participantâ€™s health, privacy, dignity, quality of life and
              independence is supported.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Participant is supported to understand under what
              circumstances supports can be withdrawn. Access to supports
              required by the Participant will not be withdrawn or denied solely
              on the basis of a dignity of risk choice that has been made by the
              Participant.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Independence and Informed Choice</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant accesses the most appropriate supports that meet
            their needs, goals and preferences.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Active decision-making and individual choice is supported for each
              Participant including the timely provision of information using
              the language, mode of communication and terms that the Participant
              is most likely to understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Participant has sufficient time to consider and review their
              options and seek advice if required, at any stage of support
              provision, including assessment, planning, provision, review and
              exit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Participantâ€™s right to access an advocate (including an
              independent advocate) of their choosing is supported, as is their
              right to have the advocate present.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ service delivery environment is safe and engaging,
            physically accessible and responsive to Participantsâ€™ support and
            communication needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ screening and eligibility, priority of access and
            waitlist management is undertaken in a fair, equitable and
            transparent manner, and in line with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Participant
            Charter. Access to services is based on relative need, service
            capacity, the best interests of people using the service and
            potential impact on existing service users.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <p>
            The Manager is responsible for ensuring staff are familiar with the
            requirements of this policy and have sufficient skills, knowledge
            and ability to meet the requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager reports to the Leadership Team on the effectiveness of
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ entry and referral processes. This is discussed at
            Leadership Team meetings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participant feedback and complaints will be addressed in accordance
            with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Feedback and Complaints Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            In accordance with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Privacy and Confidentiality
            Policy and Procedure, respect for and protection of Participantsâ€™
            privacy and confidentiality will be reinforced on an ongoing basis,
            verbally and in information promoting the services offered by the
            organisation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where required, Participants or their representatives will be
            provided with information and support to access a person of their
            choice, such as an advocate, to assist them to access the service.
            See Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Decision Making and Choice Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services uses its Participant Charter, Participant Handbook,
            to ensure Participants and their representatives understand how to
            access Wagtail Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure Participants understand this information, staff must
            provide information to them and their supporters or families in ways
            that suit their individual communication needs. Written information
            can be provided in Easy English or explained verbally by staff.
            Staff can also help Participants access interpreters or advocates
            where required.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Environment</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services ensures its service environment is kept clean,
            hygienic, safe, secure and aesthetically pleasing at all times,
            through implementing its Work Health and Safety, Risk Management;
            Incident Management, Feedback and Complaints and Continuous
            Improvement policies and procedures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ physical accessibility is ensured through its
            Physical Accessibility Policy and Procedure. Reasonable adjustments
            to the support delivery environment are made and monitored to ensure
            it is fit for purpose and that each Participantâ€™s health, privacy,
            dignity, quality of life and independence are supported.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services takes a continuous improvement approach to its
            physical accessibility and encourages Participants to use its
            Feedback and Complaints Policy and Procedure to assist it to respond
            to accessibility needs where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager tracks demand, as well as Participant and accessibility
            needs, by monitoring:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Demographic data:</strong> relating to the local community
              and its needs from Local, State and Federal Government Sources,
              including ABS data and specific NDIS market data published by the
              NDIA;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unmet need:</strong> demographic data (as above), Wagtail
              Services enquiry and waitlist data and feedback from staff,
              including those involved in local service networks; and
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Opportunities for innovation and improvement:</strong>
              through monthly review of Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Complaints Register
              and Continuous Improvement Register and annual staff and
              Participant satisfaction surveys.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Service Access</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager deals with all enquiries from prospective Participants
            or their representatives or families about accessing services. If
            the Manager doesnâ€™t take the initial enquiry personally, they will
            contact the person seeking services within 2 working days.â€ƒ
          </p>
          <p>
            Should a potential Participant be referred to Wagtail Services by
            another service or third party, the Manager should complete the
            Participant Incoming Referral Form with all relevant details and
            follow up with the Participant or their representative or family
            within 2 working days.
          </p>

          <p>
            In their first contact with the person who has enquired, the Manager
            will assess whether they require any support to move through the
            intake process. They will also:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              advise the person of their right to involve a support person in
              their dealings with Wagtail Services;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide information and assist the person to access a support
              person of their choice, such as an advocate, to help them to
              interact with the service (see Wagtail Services Decision Making
              and Choice Policy and Procedure);
            </li>
            <li>
              where physical access issues, or other issues such as availability
              of, or access to, transport, are identified, consider whether
              Wagtail Services is accessible for the person, and if not, how it
              could be made accessible; and
            </li>
            <li>
              where a language or cultural barrier is identified, engage an
              interpreter or an appropriate external agency to support the
              person. See Wagtail Services Service Delivery and Participation
              Policy and Procedure.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Manager will book an Intake Interview with the person within 5
            working days of their initial contact with them, or sooner if the
            personâ€™s needs are considered urgent.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager, or a designated employee, will conduct all Intake
            Interviews. They will provide the person with information about:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>entry and exit procedures;</li>
            <li>eligibility and priority of access requirements;</li>
            <li>conditions that may apply to service provision; and</li>
            <li>fees.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Manager will undertake an assessment of a Participantâ€™s
            eligibility based on:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>the best interests of the Participant;</li>
            <li>service guidelines; and</li>
            <li>identified Participant needs and risks.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where relevant, the interview will take into account information
            already provided about the Participant in their NDIS Plan. The
            Manager will provide the person with:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a Wagtail Services Participant Handbook, outlining Wagtail
              Servicesâ€™ entry and exit procedures and appeal processes (see
              service refusal below), priority of access requirements, waitlist
              procedures, fees, hours of operation, booking procedures,
              conditions that apply to service delivery (including when supports
              may be withdrawn), rights and responsibilities, privacy and
              confidentiality, and feedback and complaints processes;
            </li>
            <li>
              information about fees associated with the delivery of supports;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Participant Charter, Privacy Statement and
              Feedback and Complaints Form.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the Participant is offered services at the Intake Interview and
            this is accepted, they or their representative will be asked to
            complete Wagtail Servicesâ€™ intake forms, including the Participant
            Details Form, Consent Form and Participant Acknowledgement Form.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where a decision regarding whether the Participant can be offered
            services cannot be made at the Intake Interview, the Manager will
            contact the person or their representative within 2 working days of
            the Intake Interview to advise them of the outcome. If the
            Participant is offered services, intake forms should be emailed out
            for completion or the relevant person provided the opportunity to
            complete them in person.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where the Participant is offered services and accepts, for next
            steps, see Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Assessment, Planning and Review Policy
            and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Non-acceptance</h3>

          <p>
            Where a person is offered services but chooses not to accept the
            offer, staff will respect this choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager will encourage the person to contact Wagtail Services
            should they change their mind, noting that they may need to be
            placed on Wagtail Servicesâ€™ waitlist if the service has no capacity
            to provide services at the time they do recontact.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Refusal</h3>

          <p>
            Where services cannot be provided, the person will be provided with
            a clear reason based on Wagtail Servicesâ€™ eligibility criteria,
            Priority of Access requirements or waiting list processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services may refuse to offer a Participant services where:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              they do not meet Wagtail Servicesâ€™ eligibility requirements;
            </li>
            <li>
              other potential Participants are assessed as a higher priority
              based on Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Priority of Access criteria;
            </li>
            <li>
              Wagtail Services does not have the capacity to cater to additional
              Participants; or
            </li>
            <li>
              Wagtail Services does not have the resources to cater to the
              specific needs of the Participant.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            A Participant who meets Wagtail Servicesâ€™ eligibility requirements
            and cannot be offered a service due to lack of capacity, can be
            placed on Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Waiting List. The person will be advised
            of the possible waiting time before services might become available.
          </p>

          <p>
            In either case, the person will be assisted with referrals and
            support to access alternative services, as per Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            Providing Information, Advice and Referrals Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Waiting List Processes</h3>

          <p>
            The Manager will contact people on Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Waiting List at
            least every three months to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>advise them of their current status on the list;</li>
            <li>check whether they want to remain on the list;</li>
            <li>
              provide referrals to other service providers if required; and
            </li>
            <li>advise the estimated wait time remaining.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            To keep Waiting List size and wait times to a minimum, at the
            Managerâ€™s discretion, additional services will be offered where
            justified by demand and Wagtail Servicesâ€™ resources allow.
          </p>

          <h3>Appeal</h3>

          <p>
            Anyone refused services has the right to appeal the Managerâ€™s
            decision. Appeals should be directed in writing to Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            Manager and a final decision will be made by the Leadership Team.
          </p>

          <p>
            If required, staff will provide support for a person to make an
            appeal, by either transcribing their feedback for the Managerâ€™s
            review or referring the person to interpreter or advocacy services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those not successful in their appeal will be provided written advice
            to this effect. For procedures for those who successfully appeal,
            see Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and
            Procedure
          </p>

          <p>
            If a person is unhappy with outcome of their appeal, they will be
            directed to Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Feedback and Complaints Policy and
            Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Alternative Supports</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will work collaboratively with all Participants
            refused services or their representatives, to identify alternative
            services and referrals that could best meet their needs. These will
            be provided within 5 working days.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the Participant's, representativeâ€™s or familyâ€™s consent,
            relevant information will be provided by Wagtail Services to new
            service providers to support the Participant's seamless referral.
          </p>

          <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will maintain a record of Participants who have
            been refused a service, summarising reasons for their being found
            ineligible or, if found eligible, reasons for being placed on
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Waiting List.
          </p>

          <p>
            Access, service refusal and referral information will be tracked in
            Nightingale to inform Wagtail Servicesâ€™ continuous improvement.
          </p>
