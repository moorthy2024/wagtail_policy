        <div class="content">
          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this policy and procedure is to ensure Wagtail
            Services employs and rosters sufficient numbers of appropriately
            qualified staff to safely deliver quality NDIS supports to
            Participants.
          </p>

          <p>
            It applies to all Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Staff and meets relevant
            legislation, regulations and standards as set out in Schedule 1,
            Legislative References.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Continuity of Supports</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Each Participant has access to timely and
            appropriate support without interruption.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Day-to-day operations are managed in an efficient and effective
              way to avoid disruption and ensure continuity of supports.
            </li>

            <li>
              In the event of worker absence or vacancy, a suitably qualified
              and/or experienced person performs the role.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arrangements are in place to ensure support is provided to the
              Participant without interruption throughout the period of their
              Service Agreement. These arrangements are relevant and
              proportionate to the scope and complexity of supports delivered by
              the provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where changes or interruptions are unavoidable, alternative
              arrangements are explained and agreed with the Participant.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Ordinary hours</strong> - a staff memberâ€™s normal and
            regular hours of work, which do not attract overtime rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Roster</strong> - a timetable that sets out the days and
            times staff are required to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Spread of hours</strong> - the time of the day ordinary
            hours are worked (e.g. 6am to 8pm).
          </p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will employ enough appropriately qualified and
            experienced staff, to meet legislative, policy and service standards
            based on the supports that Wagtail Services provides.
          </p>

          <p>
            Day-to-day operations are managed in an efficient and effective way
            to avoid disruption and ensure continuity of supports.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event of staff absence or vacancy, a suitably qualified
            and/or experienced person will be placed in the role.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <p>
            Staff will be employed and provided training in accordance with
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Human Resources Policy and Procedure, based on the
            nature and complexity of the role. Wagtail Services will only
            provide services to Participants where it has the staff with the
            necessary qualifications to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staffing allocations for group activities will have regard to the
            ratios set out in the NDIS Price Guide.
          </p>

          <h3>Rosters and Ordinary Hours of Work</h3>
          <p>
            Ordinary hours of work are set out in employment contracts. The
            Manager is responsible for developing staff rosters and these will
            be provided to staff on a fortnightly basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should a change to a staff memberâ€™s regular roster or ordinary hours
            of work be required, the Manager will first discuss this with the
            staff member, providing as much notice as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because the needs of Participants change, staff rosters may need to
            be adjusted from time to time. Wagtail Services cannot guarantee
            that staff will always retain the same roster they were assigned
            upon employment. Further, working a temporary schedule does not
            signify a change to the staff memberâ€™s official roster.
          </p>

          <h3>Overtime</h3>

          <p>
            Full-time staff are entitled to overtime penalty rates if they work:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              more than the maximum number of ordinary hours of work (per day or
              per week, as stipulated in their Award); or
            </li>
            <li>outside the spread of ordinary hours.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Part-time staff are entitled to overtime rates if they work more
            than the maximum number of ordinary hours of work (per day or per
            week). Part-time staff will not be paid overtime rates if they work
            more than their agreed hours, but less than full-time ordinary
            hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            Casual staff will be paid overtime if they work more than the
            maximum number of ordinary hours of work (per day or per week).
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff who are called back to work after finishing their shift must
            be given at least 2 hours of work. If they donâ€™t work these hours,
            they will still be paid a minimum 2 hours at overtime rates.
          </p>

          <p>
            A staff member who works more than 4 hours of overtime when they are
            called back to work is entitled to an extra 20-minute paid break.
            They will be given a further 20-minute paid break for each 4 hours
            of overtime.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services can request that a staff member works overtime,
            provided the following things are taken into account:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              any risk to their health and safety from working the extra hours;
            </li>
            <li>
              their personal situation, including their family responsibilities;
            </li>
            <li>the needs of the workplace;</li>
            <li>
              if the staff member is entitled to receive overtime payments or
              penalty rates for working the extra hours;
            </li>
            <li>
              if they are paid at a higher rate on the understanding that they
              work some overtime;
            </li>
            <li>if they were given enough notice;</li>
            <li>
              if they have already stated they canâ€™t ever work overtime; and
            </li>
            <li>the usual patterns of work in the industry.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Health and safety issues must be considered and managed if a staff
            member is required to work overtime, particularly fatigue.
          </p>

          <p>
            A member of the Leadership Team may approve overtime. A member of
            the Leadership Team may authorise short-term, emergency overtime to
            cover staff shortages occurring after business hours or on weekends.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more information on overtime, breaks and other allowances, see
            the Social and Community Services Award at www.fairwork.gov.au.
          </p>

          <h3>Planned and Unplanned Leave</h3>

          <p>
            Staff are entitled to take planned leave (annual leave, long service
            leave and maternity leave) or unplanned leave (sick/carerâ€™s leave,
            bereavement leave, domestic violence leave) in accordance with their
            employment contract. Wagtail Services meets the minimum leave
            requirements as per the National Employment Standards, or the staff
            memberâ€™s relevant Award (whichever is the greater).
          </p>

          <p>
            For absences due to a work-related injury or illness and Workerâ€™s
            Compensation, refer to Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Workplace Incident
            Management Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <h3>Requests for Flexible Working Arrangements</h3>

          <p>
            Staff who have been employed part-time or full-time for at least 12
            months have the legal right to request flexible working arrangements
            if they:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>have parenting or caring responsibilities;</li>
            <li>have a disability;</li>
            <li>are aged over 55;</li>
            <li>are experiencing family violence; or</li>
            <li>care for or support someone experiencing family violence.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Casual staff can make a request if theyâ€™ve been working consistently
            for Wagtail Services for at least 12 months and they and Wagtail
            Services expect theyâ€™ll continue to do so.
          </p>

          <p>Staff can request to change their:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>hours of work;</li>
            <li>
              pattern of work (for instance, working split shifts or job
              sharing); and
            </li>
            <li>work location (such as working from home).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff who want flexible working arrangements must submit their
            request to the Manager in writing. This request must detail:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>the changes in working arrangements they want made; and</li>
            <li>the reason/s for seeking the change.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff can use the example templates provided on the Fair Work
            Ombudsmanâ€™s website for guidance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before formally responding to a request, the Manager must discuss it
            with the staff member and try to reach an agreement that
            accommodates the staff memberâ€™s circumstances. As part of this
            process, the Manager must consider:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>the needs of the staff member;</li>
            <li>
              consequences for the staff member if changes in arrangements are
              not made; and
            </li>
            <li>any reasonable business grounds for refusing the request.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Following their discussion, the Manager must provide a written
            response to the staff member. The written response must be provided
            within 21 days of the staff member submitting their written request.
            Each Award includes specific detail on what needs to be included in
            written responses (see www.fairwork.gov.au).
          </p>

          <h3>Refusal</h3>

          <p>
            If a request is refused, the Managerâ€™s written response must provide
            the reasons for refusal, as well as any alternative working
            arrangements that Wagtail Services can accommodate. Requests for
            flexible working arrangements can only be refused on reasonable
            business grounds.
          </p>

          <p>Examples of reasonable business grounds are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the arrangements requested would be too costly to implement;
            </li>
            <li>
              there is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other
              staff to accommodate the request;
            </li>
            <li>
              it would be impractical to change the working arrangements of
              other staff, or recruit new staff, to accommodate the request;
            </li>
            <li>
              the arrangements would likely result in significant loss of
              efficiency or productivity; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the arrangements would likely have a significant negative impact
              on customer service.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Appeal</h3>

          <p>
            Should a staff member disagree with the Managerâ€™s decision, they can
            lodge an appeal. Appeals should be directed in writing to the
            Manager and a final decision will be made by Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            Leadership Team.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff members who successfully appeal the original decision (in full
            or in part) will have agreed working arrangements implemented as
            soon as possible. Staff who are not successful in their appeal will
            be provided advice in writing to this effect by the Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is a breach of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) if the requirements
            outlined above are not fulfilled. Staff may also be able to take
            legal action under state and federal discrimination legislation,
            including the discrimination provisions of the Fair Work Act 2009,
            if they feel that the handling of their request for flexible working
            arrangements constitutes discrimination.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any staff member who has an enquiry regarding requests for flexible
            working arrangements can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman by:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              making an enquiry online at
              https://www.fairwork.gov.au/contact-us/online-enquiries; or
            </li>
            <li>phoning 13 13 94.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Staff Absences and Vacancies</h3>

          <p>
            In the event of staff absence or vacancy, the Manager will ensure
            that a suitably qualified and experienced person will be organised
            to replace the staff member to provide continuity of services for
            Participants.
          </p>

          <h3>Staff Shortages</h3>

          <p>
            When an individual is unable to work their scheduled shift, a staff
            shortage may occur. Staff who are unable to work their scheduled
            shift must notify the Manager as soon as possible, with minimum 4
            hoursâ€™ notice (unless an emergency has occurred).
          </p>

          <p>
            While it is Wagtail Servicesâ€™ practice to try to fill staff
            shortages through voluntary means (such as swapping shifts or
            seeking nominations from staff who would like to work additional
            hours), when critical shortages occur, staff may be required to work
            additional hours, including overtime hours, in order to ensure
            continuity of support for Participants.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Manager is responsible for approving additional hours of work.
            Where possible, additional work will be limited to 12-hour shifts
            and consider any potential fatigue or safety concerns. In cases of
            extreme staff shortages, such as in a severe weather event, natural
            disaster or pandemic illness, staff may be required to work longer
            shifts. All staff members are expected to share the responsibility
            of covering unexpected staff shortages. Staff are also expected to
            keep overtime usage to a minimum.
          </p>

          <h3>Vacancies</h3>

          <p>
            Staff vacancies must be managed in accordance with Wagtail Servicesâ€™
            Succession Planning and Human Resources policies and procedures.
          </p>

          <h3>Termination of Employment</h3>

          <p>
            If a staff member decides to leave their employment with Wagtail
            Services, they must provide the minimum notice as stated in their
            employment contract, based on the relevant industrial Award or
            instrument. This notice must be provided in writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services has the discretion to pay the staff member their
            notice period in lieu of having them attend work for the notice
            period (in part or in full). Wagtail Services will ensure all wages
            and entitlements are paid to the staff member within 14 days of the
            end of their employment, and provide a final payslip.
          </p>

          <p>
            For circumstances where Wagtail Services may terminate a staff
            memberâ€™s employment, refer to Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Human Resources
            Policy and Procedure.
          </p>
