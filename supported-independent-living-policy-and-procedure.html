          <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

          <p>
            This policy and procedure sets out how Wagtail Services ensures that
            supports provided in supported independent living (SIL) environments
            take into consideration the rights and responsibilities of
            Participants. It is also intended to provide staff with guidance on
            safe and supportive practices in SIL environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            It applies to all Participants of Wagtail Servicesâ€™ SIL services,
            their family members, appointed decision makers, carers and other
            supporters and meets relevant legislation, regulations and Standards
            as set out in Schedule 1, Legislative References.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where the directions in this policy and procedure differ from other
            Wagtail Services policies and procedures for Participants of all
            services, this policy and procedure supersedes other directions, for
            Participants in SIL environments.
          </p>

          <h2>Applicable NDIS Practice Standards</h2>

          <h3>Service Agreements with Participants</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome</strong>
            Each Participant has a clear understanding of the supports they have
            chosen and how they will be provided.
          </p>

          <h3>Indicators</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Where the provider delivers supported independent living supports
              to Participants in specialist disability accommodation dwellings,
              documented arrangements are in place with each Participant and
              each specialist disability accommodation provider. At a minimum,
              the arrangements should outline the party or parties responsible
              and their roles (where applicable) for the following matters:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  How a Participantâ€™s concerns about the dwelling will be
                  communicated and addressed;
                </li>
                <li>
                  How potential conflicts involving Participant(s) will be
                  managed;
                </li>
                <li>
                  How changes to Participant circumstances and/or support needs
                  will be agreed and communicated;
                </li>
                <li>
                  In shared living, how vacancies will be filled, including each
                  Participantâ€™s right to have their needs, preferences and
                  situation taken into account; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  How behaviours of concern which may put tenancies at risk will
                  be managed, if this is a relevant issue for the Participant.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            When providing services in SIL environments, Wagtail Services will:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              work with Participants in a collaborative way to ensure the safety
              and wellbeing of all Participants;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure that risks are managed in a proactive and positive way;
            </li>
            <li>
              respect the privacy and confidentiality of each Participant; and
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure processes are in place to maintain the workplace safety of
              Wagtail Services staff.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Procedure</h2>

          <h3>Managing Risk and Participants with Different Needs</h3>

          <p>
            Each SIL environment that provides shared accommodation for two or
            more Participants must have a Risk Management Plan in place,
            including individual Participant Risk Assessments, to ensure
            Participants do not represent a risk to each other, and that placing
            Participants together does not increase their individual
            vulnerability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participant Risk Assessments must be conducted prior to a
            Participantâ€™s entry into the SIL environment and be used to consider
            the acceptance of their referral or request.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participant Risk Assessments must be reviewed at least every three
            months for each Participant. Regularity of reviews should be based
            on the associated risks, the Participantâ€™s functionality and the
            Participantâ€™s wishes. Risk assessments must be reviewed more often
            where required, such as after an incident occurs.
          </p>

          <h3>Participant Privacy</h3>

          <p>
            All Participant information must be maintained in accordance with
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Records and Information Management and Privacy and
            Confidentiality policies and procedures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participantsâ€™ rooms and personal belongings must be treated with the
            upmost respect for their individual privacy. The Participantâ€™s
            preferences for privacy must be assessed on entry to the environment
            and regularly during reviews, and documented in their Support Plan
            (see Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and
            Procedure).
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must comply with Participantsâ€™ privacy preferences, which may
            include knocking before entering the Participantâ€™s room, or having
            individual private time during the day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must not access Participantsâ€™ rooms or belongings without
            their permission, unless in an emergency or other unforeseen event.
          </p>

          <h3>Behaviour Management</h3>

          <p>
            Participants in SIL environments may display behaviours that pose a
            risk to themselves or others, including staff.
          </p>

          <p>Should an incident occur, staff should:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              attempt to de-escalate the situation, if it is safe to do so;
            </li>
            <li>
              if it is not safe, remove other Participants and themselves from
              immediate danger;
            </li>
            <li>contact their supervisor or the Manager;</li>
            <li>
              if safe to do so, observe the Participant to monitor their safety;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              re-approach the Participant only when the situation has
              de-escalated and it is safe to do so.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff must follow relevant Wagtail Services policies and procedures
            for managing Participant behaviour and identifying and responding to
            harm and incidents. These include Wagtail Servicesâ€™:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Decision Making and Choice Policy and Procedure;</li>
            <li>Protecting Participants from Harm Policy and Procedure;</li>
            <li>Participant Incident Management Policy and Procedure;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff must also take the least restrictive approach to managing
            behaviour through the physical environment. Participants have the
            right to access all areas of their home and should not be restricted
            from accessing certain rooms or areas. Refer to the Positive
            Behaviour Support and Use of Restrictive Practices Policies and
            Procedures for more information.
          </p>

          <h3>House Rules</h3>

          <p>
            Each SIL environment is unique, depending on the Participants who
            reside there. As such, house rules should be developed and reviewed
            whenever a new Participant moves in to the home, with all of the
            Participants that live there. Participants should be involved as
            much as possible in developing the house rules. Their families or
            other representatives may also be involved where appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>House rules may include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>that there is â€˜quiet timeâ€™ at certain times of the day;</li>
            <li>that all Participants will treat each other with respect;</li>
            <li>that Participants will not misuse shared resources;</li>
            <li>
              that Participants will, to the best of their ability, contribute
              to a harmonious environment within the house; and
            </li>
            <li>
              that Wagtail Services staff will support Participants to resolve
              any issues in a timely manner.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It is important that SIL environments are treated as a home
            environment to the greatest extent possible. As such, it is not
            appropriate to display house rules prominently in the home. However,
            they should be clearly discussed and agreed with all Participants
            and be easily accessible to all Participants and their families or
            other representatives.
          </p>

          <h2>Supporting Documents</h2>

          <p>Documents relevant to this policy and procedure include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Participant Charter</li>
            <li>Participant Risk Assessment</li>
            <li>Decision Making and Choice Policy and Procedure</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>Monitoring and Review</h2>

          <p>
            This Policy and Procedure will be reviewed at least annually by the
            Leadership Team. Reviews will incorporate staff, Participant and
            other stakeholder feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ feedback collection mechanisms, such as
            Participant satisfaction surveys, will assess Participantsâ€™
            satisfaction with Wagtail Servicesâ€™ SIL environments and the
            services and support provided within them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Servicesâ€™ Continuous Improvement Register will be used to
            record improvements identified and monitor the progress of their
            implementation. Where relevant, this information will be considered
            as part of Wagtail Servicesâ€™ service planning and delivery
            processes.
