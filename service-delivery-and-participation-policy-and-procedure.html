            <li></li>
            <li>
              Supports are provided based on the least intrusive options, in
              accordance with contemporary evidence-informed practices that meet
              Participant needs and help achieve desired outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where agreed in the service agreement, and with the Participant’s
              consent or direction, links are developed and maintained through
              collaboration with other providers to share information and meet
              Participant needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reasonable efforts are made to involve the Participant in
              selecting their workers, including the preferred gender of workers
              providing personal care supports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a Participant has specific needs which require monitoring
              and/or daily support, workers are appropriately trained and
              understand the Participant’s needs and preferences.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Each Participant can easily identify workers engaged to provide
              the agreed supports.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Continuity of Supports</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Supports are planned with each Participant to meet their specific
              needs and preferences. These needs and preferences are documented
              and provided to workers prior to commencing work with each
              Participant to ensure the Participant’s experience is consistent
              with their expressed preferences.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Definitions</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Cultural competence</strong> – occurs when a business has
            structures in place to support the flexibility of its staff so they
            can meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and
            culturally and linguistically diverse Participants.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cultural safety</strong> – delivering services in a way that
            people feel safe and secure in their identity, culture and
            community. This includes planning and applying policies, strategies,
            and programs that consider, acknowledge and incorporate the history,
            traditions, diversity and circumstances of the particular Aboriginal
            and Torres Strait Islander and culturally and linguistically diverse
            groups that the business works with. Cultural safety and competency
            are about recognising the centrality of culture, language and
            country for Aboriginal people and people from culturally and
            linguistically diverse backgrounds in delivering quality supports.
            Culture and language are powerful influencers in supporting the
            positive identity, self-determination and well-being necessary to
            enhance service access, equity and effectiveness.
          </p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services promotes a person-centred approach to its service
            delivery where individuals lead and direct their services and are
            supported to maintain connections with their family, friends and
            communities.
          </p>

          <h2>Procedures</h2>

          <p>
            Participants’ assessment documentation (see Wagtail Services’
            Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and Procedure) must be
            provided to the staff who will work with them, prior to the staff
            commencing work with them, to ensure the Participant’s service
            delivery is consistent with their expressed preferences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Support staff must be introduced to Participants prior to commencing
            the delivery of supports, and clearly identify themselves to
            Participants at each instance of service delivery.
          </p>

          <h3>Continuity of Supports</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services is committed to providing support to Participants
            without interruption throughout the period of their Service
            Agreement. This is supported through a range of policies and
            procedures.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Succession Planning Policy and Procedure requires Wagtail
            Services to maintain and uphold a sustainable workforce and the
            continuity of the business as a whole. Wagtail Services has
            developed a Succession Plan which aligns with its Strategic and
            Operational Plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Staffing Policy and Procedure identifies processes
            where staff members’ normal working hours may require adjustment to
            ensure continuity of care, as well as how Wagtail Services handles
            staff absences, shortages and vacancies. This is supported through
            the ongoing training and development processes outlined in the Human
            Resources Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff training and development opportunities are tracked using the
            Staff Training and Development Register. Staff are also provided
            access to the Training and Development Calendar; where opportunities
            for further skill development can be identified, to encourage
            further staff training and development and support continuity of
            care.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and Procedure identifies
            how Wagtail Services conducts reviews of Support Plans and ensures
            continuity of care through identification of any change in the
            Participants’ needs. To support Participants whose needs may have
            changed, Wagtail Services ensures Participant Risk Assessments are
            kept up to date.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event a Participant’s needs are no longer best supported by
            Wagtail Services, a Referral Database is maintained (as outlined in
            Providing Information, Advice and Referrals Policy and Procedure).
            Participants who require transition to another service provider do
            so with continuity of supports being paramount. The Service Exit
            Policy and Procedure outlines how staff are to work collaboratively
            with all stakeholders involved in a Participant’s service transition
            and how this will be documented in their Exit Plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services also ensures continuity of care to Participants by
            complying with its Risk Management Model and Practices, as outlined
            in the Risk Management Policy and Procedure. Risk management plans
            are developed and reviewed monthly and any identified risks are
            followed up by the Manager and discussed during monthly team
            meetings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ Emergency Planning Policy and Procedure outlines
            the Manager’s responsibilities to ensure Wagtail Services’
            operational readiness and that measures are in place to support
            continuity of care. This includes through identification of
            alternative plans for Participants where service delivery may be
            interrupted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where changes or interruptions are unavoidable, alternative
            arrangements must be explained and agreed with the Participant or
            their representative, with a key focus on minimising the impact to
            the Participant.
          </p>

          <h3>General Service Delivery Principles</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services puts the Participant at the centre of
            decision-making in all aspects of their life and supports
            Participants to actively participate in their community and pursue
            their interests and goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where required, staff will identify and provide referrals and
            linkages to services and activities that will enhance people’s
            community participation and provide support and assistance to help
            Participants access these. See Wagtail Services’ Providing
            Information, Advice and Referrals Policy and Procedure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services works collaboratively with disability-specific and
            mainstream services to provide holistic service delivery to its
            Participants. Services will be delivered in a way that respects
            individuals’ personal, gender, sexual, cultural, religious and
            spiritual identity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through its recruitment and staffing processes, Wagtail Services
            works to develop a diverse workforce so that Participant
            assessments, planning, service delivery and reviews benefit from
            expertise from a range of staff with varying life experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must use a strengths-based approach to identifying individual
            Participant needs and life goals, particularly in relation to
            recognising individuals’ capacity to develop their independence,
            problem solving, social and self-care skills. Each Participant will
            be supported to engage with their family, friends and chosen
            community, as directed by the Participant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must help Participants to access information they need to make
            decisions when they want to try new things or continue with options
            that may not have gone well in the past, including considering the
            benefits and risks, consequences and responsibilities to them and
            others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Access to supports required by a Participants will not be withdrawn
            or denied solely on the basis of a dignity of risk choice that has
            been made by the Participant.
          </p>

          <p>
            As per Wagtail Services’ Service Access Policy and Procedure,
            reasonable adjustments to the support delivery environment will be
            made and monitored to ensure it is fit for purpose and that each
            Participant’s health, privacy, dignity, quality of life and
            independence is supported.
          </p>

          <h3>Communication</h3>

          <p>
            People can communicate their choices, likes and dislikes in many
            ways, for example, verbal communication, withdrawal, acting out,
            engagement and disengagement, aggression, excitement, despondency
            and joyfulness. Staff are required to work with Participants in a
            way that adapts to their individual needs as they change over time,
            regardless of the frequency or cause.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staff must provide information to Participants in ways that suit
            their individual communication needs. Methods include providing
            written information in Easy English, explaining information either
            face-to-face or over the phone and using interpreters and advocates.
          </p>

          </h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services is committed to supporting Participants from
            Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and culturally and
            linguistically diverse backgrounds to maintain and strengthen their
            connection to their community, culture, spirituality and language.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services works collaboratively with Participants from
            diverse backgrounds to provide holistic service delivery. Staff
            delivering services to Participants from Aboriginal and Torres
            Strait Islander or culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
            should consider:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>that these communities are extremely diverse;</li>
            <li>
              the cultural context and the potential for significant cultural
              differences between people in terms of spiritual, ecological,
              consensual and communal beliefs and values;
            </li>
            <li>the impacts of racism and prejudice;</li>
            <li>
              translating written, electronic and verbal information or making
              it available in Easy English for people who are not proficient in
              the English language;
            </li>
            <li>
              that some migrants and former humanitarian entrants are not
              literate in their own language;
            </li>
            <li>
              communicating in a community’s preferred medium (some communities
              may prefer printed information rather than verbal);
            </li>
            <li>
              allowing sufficient time for cross-cultural input and
              communication;
            </li>
            <li>
              incorporating a family-sensitive approach to support and including
              extended family members and significant others in service delivery
              by providing a range of flexible, culturally appropriate ways to
              engage;
            </li>
            <li>providing more flexible appointment times and lengths; and</li>
            <li>
              providing services in alternative, outreach, home and/or community
              environments.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff should also apply cultural protocols when supporting
            Participants from diverse backgrounds, including:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              recognising gender, how people are expected to interact with the
              opposite sex (including married and unmarried people of the
              opposite sex) and taking this into account when selecting a staff
              member to support a male or female Participant;
            </li>
            <li>
              for culturally and linguistically diverse Participants, depending
              on the period of time spent in Australia, migration experience,
              country of origin and pre-migration experience, communities may
              have mixed attitudes towards government and people of authority;
            </li>
            <li>
              for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participants,
              recognising kinship and the impact this may have on service
              delivery; and
            </li>
            <li>
              understanding the importance of notifying appropriate people in a
              Participant’s community of an intended visit.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Partnerships</h3>

          <p>
            Where possible, staff must identify and provide referrals and
            linkages to community services and activities that are operated by
            or for a Participant’s community.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Leadership Team will work closely with Aboriginal and Torres
            Strait Islander and culturally and linguistically diverse services
            in its region to establish partnerships to benefit its Participants
            and their communities. These partnerships should also inform Wagtail
            Services’ culturally secure and competent service delivery.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personal contact with community representatives such as Elders and
            Community Leaders may also be required for them to maintain an
            awareness of Wagtail Services, its entry criteria, how to access it,
            and commitment to any partnership arrangements.
          </p>

          <h3>Staff Support</h3>

          <p>
            Through its recruitment and staffing processes, Wagtail Services
            endeavours to develop a culturally diverse and competent workforce
            to support culturally-appropriate service delivery.
          </p>

          <p>
            In line with Wagtail Services’ Human Resources Policy and Procedure,
            staff are regularly provided with training and development
            opportunities, which includes cross-cultural training and support to
            develop skills and knowledge about different communities and people
            from diverse backgrounds. They may also be trained in engagement
            skills and the use of Interpreters.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services also endeavours to employ staff from diverse
            backgrounds and will consider the following strategies to support
            and retain them:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              hold events that celebrate workplace diversity and encourage
              employees to share their cultures and experiences;
            </li>
            <li>
              set up internal and external mentoring and supervision
              arrangements with people of the same background; and
            </li>
            <li>
              support them to fulfil cultural and social obligations to their
              family and community.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Environment</h3>

          <p>
            Participants from diverse backgrounds may prefer specific gender
            workers and may also prefer workers from the same cultural
            background. Staff allocation should be based on staff skills and
            training, gender, and other cultural factors. If Wagtail Services is
            not able to meet these needs, staff should provide referrals and
            linkages to other appropriate services and work closely with other
            services to ensure services are delivered in a way that is holistic,
            culturally safe and culturally competent. See the Providing
            Information, Advice and Referral Policy and Procedure for more
            information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where there are significant barriers for people to access Wagtail
            Services, it may be appropriate to take the service to them, such as
            offering outreach services through another more accessed agency, or
            home visits.
          </p>

          <h3>Promotion</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services’ promotional and Participant materials will be
            appropriate and welcoming of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
            and culturally and linguistically diverse people and inform
            communities of the business’ entry criteria, services offered and
            access requirements. Local ethnic and community radio stations,
            websites, press and other media may be used to promote services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services will also consider appointing people from diverse
            backgrounds to decision-making and advisory committees to enhance
            partnerships and communication processes and involving Community
            Leaders and Elders in face-to-face engagement and collaboration.
          </p>

          <h3>Interpreters</h3>

          <p>
            Wagtail Services recognises that the provision of language services
            is a matter of quality and safety for Participants. The delivery of
            safe, high-quality services requires effective communication with
            Participants and their representatives or families and Wagtail
            Services has a duty to provide language services appropriate to a
            person’s needs. Interpreters must be made available at no cost to
            Participants and, if relevant, their supporters.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where an interpreter is required, staff must first assess how well
            the person can understand information in English. An effective
            method for assessing English proficiency is to conduct a short,
            informal interview with the person, asking for basic details about
            their reason for making contact and their background. Stressful or
            unfamiliar environments may affect a person’s ability to communicate
            effectively, even if they generally have a level of proficiency in
            English suitable for that type of appointment or meeting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where a Participant has limited or no English language skills or
            uses Auslan, Wagtail Services must offer them the use of a
            professionally accredited interpreter to ensure the Participant
            understands and can communicate in response to the information being
            provided to them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every reasonable effort must be made to use an accredited
            interpreter before a family member or friend of the Participant is
            asked to assist. They may assist in communicating with a Participant
            where an interpreter is required but is not available and a matter
            must be dealt with in a restricted timeframe. The decision to do so,
            and the circumstances justifying that decision, must be documented
            in the Participant’s file or relevant record. As soon as practicable
            the services of a professional interpreter must be engaged to ensure
            the information has been accurately conveyed, especially in the case
            of medical or complex situations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any individual under the age of 18 must never be asked to act in the
            place of an accredited interpreter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unless they are an accredited interpreter or employed for their
            language skills, staff members who speak a language other than
            English may only assist with communicating low risk information such
            as making appointments or obtaining basic personal details such as
            name and address. Unaccredited bilingual staff cannot be used to
            communicate information that is legally binding or puts the
            Participant or Wagtail Services at risk.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following are critical points at which people with low English
            proficiency should have access to information in their preferred
            language:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the Participant is being informed of their rights (for example,
              privacy, confidentiality) and responsibilities (for example,
              fees);
            </li>
            <li>
              the Participant is required to make significant decisions
              concerning their lives (for example, provision of test results,
              medication regimes, other interventions, undertaking assessment
              and Support Planning, conducting assessment outcomes);
            </li>
            <li>
              essential information needs to be communicated and understood to
              inform decision making (for example, procedures and referral
              options); and
            </li>
            <li>
              giving informed consent (for example, to treatment, release of
              information, power of attorney and guardianship matters).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Staff can access Interpreters and Translators through the
            Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS). Services provided by TIS
            include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>telephone interpreting;</li>
            <li>on-site interpreting (spoken languages and Auslan);</li>
            <li>language translations; and</li>
            <li>video remote interpreting.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Interpreting bookings including those for video remote interpreting
            can be made at
            https://www.tisnational.gov.au/Agencies/Help-using-TIS-National-services/TIS-Online-for-agencies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants or their supporters can request a preferred
            interpreter. However, while the use of the Participant’s preferred
            interpreter is recommended, if that interpreter has a qualification
            lower than a professional level, they can only interpret basic
            information. A professionally accredited interpreter must be used
            for the communication of critical or legally binding information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Information regarding access to interpreters is provided in Wagtail
            Services’ Participant Handbook, along with other information
            regarding how Wagtail Services will deliver culturally competent
            services. Relevant contact details will be included in Wagtail
            Services’ Referral Database.
          </p>

          <h3>Translation</h3>

          <p>
            Translated information can supplement interpreting services and
            provides information that the Participant can later refer to, or
            provide to family, carers and other support persons to aid
            understanding. Some people may prefer written information.
          </p>

              the cultural competence of the services provided to them;
            </li>
            <li>
              feedback from people on their satisfaction with supports provided
              to maintain and strengthen their independent life skill; and

            </li>
          </ul>
